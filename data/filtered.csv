ISO 9001:2015 certifiedPED Compliant Alpha’s experienced staff, combined with the latest technology, allow them to boast six-sigma grade process control with very little variation and high repeatability.  We take pride in forming partnerships with our customers to work together to reduce part cost by using strategic casting designs with superior quality. Specializing in Hundreds of Unique Alloys StreamlinedOperations QuickTurnarounds AffordablePricing Engineering &Manufacturing Alpha Investment Casting is the elite name in the industry, where quality and the customer are the top priorities. Pride AndInnovation On December 5, 1791, Alexander Hamilton presented to the newly formed House of Representatives his ""Report on Manufacturers"". In this report Hamilton proposes that the American government should support manufacturing as an ""integral part of the American economy"". This report sparked the beginning of America’s world dominance in manufacturing, innovation and entrepreneurialism. All we need do is review American history with names like Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and so many others to see what Hamilton’s visionary report created. However, some of that vision has been lost over the last couple of decades as more and more companies move manufacturing jobs out of the country. At Alpha Investment Casting, made in America is just the first part of our vision of “Making it in America”. When you take made in America, add a lot of pride, some innovation and a heap of entrepreneurialism you get what “Making it in America” really means. So if you are looking for someone who is “Making it in America”, you might want to give us a call. Contact us at918-834-4686to create the custom castings you need. ",1936,292
14,"Why Investment Casting? The investment casting process yields unrivaled quality to other casting methods. At Alpha Investment Casting, we produce hundreds of alloys from the simplest to the most complex designs. Using our casting methods, combined with the design freedom of investment casting, our staff can consistently produce high quality parts with supreme repeatability. When compared to other casting methods or weldments, there is no substitution for investment casting quality. In many cases, certain machining operations can be eliminated with an efficient casting design.  Our staff can work with customers to eliminate waste or unnecessary operations on new and current designs. Some specific benefits of investment casting are: Repeatability and Reliability Tolerances As cast tolerances are tighter than other casting methods. Standard Investment Casting Tolerances are: 0"" to 1"":  ± 0.010"" 1"" to 2"":  ± 0.015"" 2"" to 3"":  ± 0.020"" 3"" to 4"":  ± 0.025"" for each additional inch, add 0.005"" In many cases, tighter tolerances can be achieved. Quality Investment Casting parts are visually more appealing than other casting methods.  Because of the unique process small texts, company logos and other verbiage is easily readable. A typical as cast surface finish with the investment casting process is 125 micro inches. Tool Life The tooling we use for our casting process is made from aluminum.  With only our proprietary wax being used on the tooling, the tooling will last for decades with only minor repairs necessary. Design Freedom When an investment casting design is utilized to its fullest potential, many design features that are traditionally machined can be cast to the part without adding cost.  This allows our customers and our staff to design out cost before a part is ever produced.  Intricate designs, logos, splines, thread profiles, thru holes and blind holes are just of few of the design features that we can cast. Partnership Let us partner with you.  Our staff is ready to help you decide the best way to produce your designs to the highest quality using the most efficient means possible.

37,"About Us In 1962 Cast All Corp. was established in Mineola, NY. At that time our principle product lines revolved around zinc die castings for window and door manufacturers and custom trade. In 1980 as the Window Industry evolved so did we. While still servicing all of the die cast needs of our customer base with parts as diverse as electrical stakes and air craft seat buckles, we began to produce plastic injection molded parts to meet the needs of the vinyl window market. Today, working with quality engineered plastic resins we manufacture a wide variety of parts in these materials. Tilt latches, end caps, screen corners, novelty items, just to name a few. Frequently, we provide both zinc and plastic products to the same customers. Where applicable, we introduce plastic molded parts to replace metal ones often doing away with secondary operations resulting in considerable cost savings. We would be honored to add you to our list of satisfied customers. Please feel free to contact us for a competitive quotation on any zinc die cast or plastic part utilized in any commercial application. ",1103,184

Supreme manufactures castings ranging from a few grams (about 0.1 oz) in weight to about 15 kg (33 lb). The cross-sectional limits are typically 2.5 mm (0.1 in) to 75 mm (3.0 in). Typical tolerances are +/- 0.1 mm for the first 25 mm (0.005 in for the first inch) and +/- 0.04 mm for the each additional 10mm (0.002 in for each additional inch). A standard surface finish is 1.3–4 micrometres (50–125 μin) The advantages of investment casting are  Design Design data can be obtained by adapting existing legacy data such as fabrication drawings, reverse engineering from prototype samples combined with working with and assisting the customer to create an optimal solution that exploits the benefits of the near net shape casting process.

44,"Rapid Prototyping 3D PRINTING AND CNC FOAM MACHINING We have the capability to manufacture casting prototypes using both 3D printing and machining from high density foam and then cast those designs in a range of metal alloys. Although the finish may not be to the same high quality as a part from wax, a fully functional casting will result. As significant skill and expertise is applied in the development phase with one-off castings such as prototypes, costs are higher than production run quantities. Rapid prototyping is ideal for:  In view of the popularity of 3D printing this process tends to dominate with FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) also known as FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) using PLA the most common method and the process we use. In some circumstances machining foam can be preferable. We have considerable experience using both methodologies. We have a number of 3D printers with extensive 3D printing capability and can print designs up to 500mm x 500mm x 500mm. We can also join multiple 3D printed and foam machined parts to build complex designs. The larger sizes may subject to handling constraints limiting just how large a part can be cast. Surface finish will generally not be as good as a part from wax as printing artifacts will remain, even after a tidy up. Lamination lines and signs of the support structures generally remain visible, but surprisingly good results can be achieved with some effort.

53,"Call Zinc Die casting OVERVIEW: Zinc die casting is a very meticulous process that every detail of the casting must be considered in order to come up with a product that is to produced. Also, these should be accomplished in the safest and the most economical way. How Zinc Alloy Die Casting Works? The Zinc Alloy die casting process is a forming process in which molten metal is injected into the cavity of hardened steel die. The cavity is precision machined, with tight tolerances, into a block of heat resistant tool steel. With casting process control and the uniform shrinkage charactreistic of zinc alloys, this process results in castings with exact precision. The process of zinc alloy die casting, the production cycle is the fastest of all metal casting processes due to zinc’s relatively low in melting and solidification temperature (379-390C). Zinc casting is used to produce parts from less than a gram in weight to a kilo or more.

53,"Call Tooling TYPES OF TOOLING: Typically, a zinc die casting die is quite expensive. And, many times the only difference from one die to another is some cavity feature. Many zinc castings are similar except for styling. Others can be grouped into categories of similar sizes even though the castings are otherwise quite unrelated. The designer can often achieve considerable tool construction economy by fitting the die into a standard die set or unit die. Standard Die Set ( Stand-Alone Dies ): Complete die assembly can be purchased. These are available commercially. Many dies can use these standardizations as basic building blocks for die. Increase in standardization there is usually a reduction in the original cost of the die and a reduction in construction lead time. But, there are trade offs. As tooling standardization becomes more rigid, die set-up, casting yield, and production efficiency may be sacrificed. Naturally, when there are no advantages, the highest level of standardization should be used. When there are trade offs, each option should be analyzed for its total cost effectiveness. These items are pre-machined to catalogued sizes. These sets contain all the necessary blocks, plates and rails plus sprue bushing, sprue spreader, leader pins, ejector plate guide pins, and ejector plate return pins. These items are evenly bolted together. The die builder must install the cavity blocks, ejector pins, and water cooling.  Unit Dies: Unit dies provide for relatively quick changing of cavity block in the bolster or die block. You pay for the inserts and not the whole Tool.

53,"Call Processing Auto-Hydraulic Pressing / Trimming: Some castings require more than the normal breaking off procedure when taken from the machine. This process involves the trimming of the casting or removal of overflows and runner in-gates. It also takes care of any flashing, etc that is surplus to the casting. Vibratory Finishing: This process involves removing of burrs, smoothing and brightening surfaces. Castings are vibrated with a medium of ceramic cones and mixture of polishing liquid. The liquid compound is used to keep parts clean, lubricate, cushion against damage and remove all debris from the vibratory finishing machine. After the vibratory process, they are automatically transferred to a dryer, which prepares the casting for linishing / polishing etc. Linishing: This process involves grinding, polishing and removal of roughness and part lines which feature on some castings. Normally when zinc is formed part lines are visible and sanding is the most efficient way of removing these. There are many different kinds of linishing machines that suit your needs. In this photo we show our flatbed linishing machine. POLISHING all polishing processes are available on request.

The powder coating is typically applied electrostatically and is then cured under a heat to allow it to form a “skin”. The powder maybe thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. it is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than a conventional paint.

Airfoil designs include standard and reversible flow. Many Bailsco propellers have been in service for over twenty years. Bailsco’s computer selection program allows for the optimization of propeller selection for a specific design application (CFM, HP, and SP). The program can either search all propellers for the desired performance or the search can be confined to specific diameters and speeds if desired. Generated performance curves include: octave sound data, performance at a desired temperature and elevation as well as standard conditions. The programs allow the selection of the proper “pitch match” of the airfoil design to meet virtually any set of conditions for the maximum cfm at the lowest horsepower.

56,"BailSco The Air Moving People Adjustable Pitch Propellers Bailsco’s adjustable pitch propeller (VIA and VIP) can be adjusted in the field. This product offers a sure method of insuring that each blade is correctly pitched to meet the design requirements of the propeller. It is often necessary to vary the pitch of the individual blades of a propeller in order to vary the performance characteristics of the propeller and/or to optimize the performance of the propeller relative to the output capabilities of the propeller’s power source. The VIA (Vari-Insert-Aluminum) and VIP (Vari-Insert-Plastic) is designed to provide a variable pitch blade in which the mechanism for setting and locking the blade in a desired pitch position is easily interchangeable, is easily fabricated, provides wide flexibility in setting a desired blade pitch position, and provides positive locking along the entire root shank of the blade to be fixed. This is accomplished by the use of locking inserts which slip into sockets in a hub half. Changing the pitch is done easily by unbolting the hub halves, removing the inserts, replacing the inserts with different pitch inserts, and bolting the two hub halves together again. No more protractors, just change inserts and go! Return to top of page Copyright © 2023 BailSco Blades & Castings, Inc.www.bailsco.comWeb Design & Development byMomentum New Media ",1387,219

58,"Hebert Foundry & Machine, Inc. has extensive experience in the aluminum sand casting foundry industry. The process of pouring molten aluminum into a sand mold continues to be a cost effective process, supplying parts to a variety of industries. Because of its positive features, aluminum remains the metal of choice across the automotive industry. Notwithstanding the automotive industry, aluminum sand casting continues to be used in other areas of the transportation industry including in aircraft and marine applications.Other industries served include machine tool fabrication, communication, medical and laboratory testing equipment, and food preparation machinery. Aluminum sand casting is the right choice for products that require hollow cavities and complex, unique arrangements of voids, shapes and ribs. Aluminum sand castings can be supplied in sizes from fractions of an ounce to 400 pounds; from 3/8 inch to 120 inches in width or length; and from one piece to tens of thousands of units.Aluminum castings are typically 0.10 pounds per cubic inch vs. 0.25 for ZA-12, 0.28 for iron, 0.29 for steel, 0.30/0.31 for brass/bronze, 0.33 for stainless steel. For high quantity applications, HFM can supply and machine permanent mold aluminum sand castings for the lowest price and highest dimensional quality with short turnaround times.HFM provides aluminum sand casting in the following alloys:• 355 and 356 aluminum alloys which are heat treated to T6 and T7 conditions• 319 aluminum alloy which is typically used without heat treatment (F)• 443 aluminum alloy• 535 aluminum-magnesium alloy for elongation and corrosion resistance• 713 aluminum alloy for physical strength of 356 without the heat treatment• ZA-12 zinc-aluminum for replacement of grey iron castings in many applications  ",1798,270
58,"Hebert Foundry and Machine, Inc. is a family owned and operated business with nearly 100 years of experience in the green sand casting and machining industries. Our staff of engineers, patternmakers, and metallurgists will ensure that your company chooses the right material and pattern to address your green sand casting needs. Green Sand Casting continues as the most widely used and cost effective process for sand casting. The process begins with the creation of a pattern that duplicates the shape of the desired part. Depending on the application of the part and desired outcome, HFM offers two sand compositions for the no bake sand casting process. One no bake sand casting process utilizes a molding material that is low cost and reusable. Typically, green sand is composed of washed, graded, dried, and screened/sized silica sand that is bonded with various natural clays and water. Other ingredients are used to achieve specific properties to allow molten metal to be formed in “near net shape”. The alternative composition utilizes sand molds of chemically bonded sand that are only used once. This process is superior for heavier castings and generally exhibits better dimensional control than traditional green sand. The “no-bake” molds can be assembled to form intricate castings. Cores, created from various compositions within the mold cavity, form the internal (and sometimes intricate) structure of hollow castings. The green sand casting process, and the no-bake sand casting process, facilitates the casting of complex parts. Castings produced from green sand handle vibration and stress much better than assemblies secured by fasteners. HFM green sand castings reduce weight and furnish rounded edges that are safer and more aesthetically pleasing than sharp, machined edges. The green sand casting process reduces the need for assemblies which significantly minimizes the need for machining and ultimately improves the tolerance of the finished product.  ",1978,304

82,"sales@sdcofin.com About Us SDC was originally founded in the early 60's by Barclay F. Smith as Scotch Diecasting Company. The company operated in Berkley, MO, a suburb of St. Louis. In 1976 the company was sold and later re-incorporated as SDC Inc.  B.F. Smith later went on to found other companies in the St Louis area before fully retiring. In 1980 SDC constructed a 15,000 sq. ft. manufacturing plant situated on a 3 acre lot in Sullivan, MO. Zinc die casting was its main focus, but aluminum die casting was soon added to facilitate new customers. Throughout the 80's and 90's secondary services continued to be added to add value the castings being produced. In 2016 SDC constructed an additional 8,500 sq. ft. onto existing building for increased manufacturing space and improved shipping / warehouse space. Like many companies in the past several years, SDC has redefined its core business of 30 years and became a leaner and more agile supplier. We have expanded services and responsibilities to a broader range of products and materials. As of April 1, 2022 SDC Inc. was acquired by SDC of Indiana LLC.

82,"sales@sdcofin.com Aluminum Die Casting Aluminum Die Cast equipment ranges from 300 Tons to 700 Tons clamping capacity. The machinery has PLC controllers to stabilize the process. The aluminum machines utilize an advanced pressure pour dosing furnace. The furnaces are controlled by the PLC to dispense the molten metal to the machine automatically. This dosing process has proven to be the most efficient method to deliver pure aluminum alloy to the die cast machine. Aluminum Die Cast Alloys 380, 383, 360 & 413 are standard alloys run. The size produced ranges varies from an ounce or less to a 6 pound casting weight. As the parts are cast with the machines running an automatic cycle they are operator monitored and defects are removed as they are produced, as the castings are cooled they are then trimmed from the runner system and further processed thru secondary operations as needed. Parts are burnished, machined, plated, or powder coated as required by the customer. From a simple knob or handle to a complex valve body or fishing reel frame, aluminum Die castings offer great dimensional stability, repeatability, corrosion resistance (A360, A413), and strength. From toys to trains, to planes, to lawnmowers, to power tools the usage of aluminum continues to play a part in most every industry. ALUMINUM ALLOYS Aluminum die casting alloys are lightweight, offer good corrosion resistance, ease of casting, good mechanical properties and dimensional stability. 360 -Selected for good corrosion resistance. Special alloys for special applications are available, but their use usually entails significant cost premiums. 380 -An alloy which provides the best combination of utility and cost. 383 & 384 -These alloys are a modification of 380. Both provide better die filling, but with a moderate sacrifice in mechanical properties, such as toughness. 390 -Selected for special applications where high strength, fluidity and wear-resistance/bearing properties are required. 413 -Used for maximum pressure tightness, fluidity, and corrosion resistance.

82,"sales@sdcofin.com Zinc Die Casting Zinc Die Castings, while being over twice as heavy as aluminum, have many uses in the everyday products we use today. Zinc alloys offer tight tolerances and extremely repeatable production processes. SDC uses Frech fully automatic zinc machines producing parts ranging from a few grams to 2.5 pounds. Zinc parts can be produced to extremely fine detail with very little draft required on sidewalls and cored holes. Zinc Die castings tooling is long lasting and easy to maintain compared to Aluminum tolling. The melting temperature is lower in zinc die casting as well as the pressure required to produced the casting is much less than aluminum. If your part is a part requiring close tolerances or thin complex shapes zinc die casting may well be the answer to saving special machining operations. Our team will be happy to assist you in your evaluation. Zinc Alloys Zinc-based alloys are the easiest to die cast. Ductility is high and impact strength is excellent, making these alloys suitable for a wide range of products. Zinc alloys can be cast with thin walls and excellent surface smoothness making preparation for plating and painting relatively easy. It is essential that only high purity (99.99 + 0/0) zinc metal be used in the formulation of alloys. Low limits on lead, tin and cadmium ensure the long-term integrity of the alloys strength and dimensional stability. Zinc-aluminum (Za) Alloys ZA alloys represent a family of zinc-based die casting materials which contain higher aluminum content than standard zinc alloys. These alloys provide high strength characteristics plus high hardness and good bearing properties. Thin wall castability characteristics and die life are similar to zinc alloys. ZA-8 is recommended for hot chamber die casting, whereas ZA-12 and ZA-27 must be cast by the cold chamber die casting process. All ZA alloys offer similar creep properties and are superior to standard zinc alloys. Four-Slide Die Casting Four-Slide Zinc Die casting is a special method of Die Casting requiring a special type of Die Casting machinery. SDC uses Dynacast Model 2A machines. While being limited on size (Max part weight 40g), the machines are extremely efficient & highly accurate. Parts are cast to net shape at speeds up to 40 shots/min. Most tooling for the 4 slide machine will be more economical than for conventional die cast tooling. If you require small complex parts in high volumes over 25,000 per order, the multi-slide approach may be you best solution. Typical applications are connectors, small housings, office parts, small valves, munitions components, air fittings, special components, fractional motor brackets, Nano technology packaging.

106,"Permanent Mold Including Tilting Furnaces Introduction to Permanent Molding Permanent mold casting is accomplished through the use of an iron (typically cast iron) mold. The use of permanent molds, while somewhat costly to initially build the mold, benefits from a lower per casting cost on longer runs and complex parts can be made with much better quality and repeatability. Our foundry uses two types of permanent mold: base mounted permanent mold that is gravity (ladle) poured, and furnace mounted tilt pour molds that use a small amount of automation and the pressure of a pool of molten aluminum above the part being cast, to ensure complete filling of the mold and therefore a good casting. When designing a permanent mold the following should be considered when engineering the part to be cast: minimum wall thickness of -.125 inches for distances less than 3 inches and more for longer distances, minimum inside and outside radius equal to .125, minimum draft angle of 1° on outside surfaces and 2° on inside surfaces should be heeded to promote a good design. Typical tolerances .020 on the first inch and .002 per additional inch as accuracy guidelines. Typical part sizes range from 1 ounce to 20 lbs. and more. Much larger parts can be cast using a permanent mold if the quality required justifies the cost of building the tooling. Permanent mold castings are gravity-fed and the pouring rate is kept quite low. The metal mold causes rapid cooling. This supports a relatively quick cycle time to using the mold and helps to achieve a lower casting cost. Permanent mold castings provide excellent mechanical properties when made with an appropriate alloy. The mechanical properties of permanent mold castings made with certain alloys (for instance A356) can be further improved by heat treating. Heat treating brings these alloys to full strength and hardness. To explore how we can supply you with the necessary components for your products, please call us at (909) 391-4131.

110,"Industrial Ferguson Foundry Corp. has been supplying quality non-ferrous sand castings to America's industries for over 50 years. Now in our third generation, we offer the ability to cast over 25 different metals ranging from electrolytic copper and aluminum to alloys covering nearly all requirements that our customers could need. We have the capabilities to produce castings in quantities ranging from one piece to thousands and in sizes from ounces to 250 lbs. in aluminum based metals and from ounces to 400 lbs in copper based metals. We are both a high quality job shop capable of production pattern and tooling quality castings from loose patterns and a full service light production facility capable of delivering our customers ""just-in-time"" and continuous orders. We offer the customer service from blueprint to final casting including machined castings. In 2003, Industrial Ferguson Foundry merged with Aluminum Matchplate Co., This combination brought the talent and expertise for the combined company to produce castings of high surface finish quality, cast with some of the finest sands available. Current customers that take advantage of this service include the plastic thermoform packaging industry, pattern shops for foundry tooling, and the plastic injection molding industry as well as architectural restoration, memorial plaque, ornamental and lighting restoration industries. In addition, this merger brought the capability to produce highly complex castings with complicated core sets requiring the utmost internal integrity for the most critical industrial application. Examples include pump and valve castings, impellers, OEM machine parts, replacement parts, prototypes, marine castings, lighting castings, electrical components including connectors and hardware for the power transmission industry, gears, transmission housings and many others, all produced with high attention to surface, dimensional and internal quality. The capability and quality that Industrial-Ferguson Foundry has come to maintain has been realized by controlling the size of our operation and by carefully choosing our process to optimize control over the production process. We are large enough to produce a customer's large requirements in a '""just in time"" manner, yet small enough for owners to have ""hands on"" control of the process. In addition, selected automation has been installed in non-critical process to insure our competitive edge without compromising our flexibility or diverse capabilities. The result is that the customer realizes the quality, service and competitive pricing that they require in the ever changing competitive industrial environment of today. At Industrial Ferguson Foundry Corp., the science and technology of today complement the foundry art of yesterday to offer the casting buyer all the benefits needed to be competitive now and in the future.

Our experienced team can help with casting design and pattern set up, including running systems to ensure a quality, defect free casting is produced. Industries we support include: The largest project JAMES COPPELL LEE was proud to be involved in was the “Fountain of Wealth“ located in Suntec City Singapore.It is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the World’s Largest Fountain.  A 12 month undertaking during 1994/5, the fountain is fabricated from hundreds of Silicon Bronze cast Panels. The curved shape panels typically were approximately 1200 square x 6 mm thick, the majority cast at our foundry in La Trobe Street, Melbourne. Our team was confronted with many challenges, including capacity, the required lead times and logistics. Moulds were large and could weigh up to 1500 kgs each. The castings needed to be of very high quality with precision finishing. The fountain is 14 metres tall, 66 metres in circumference, weighing apx. 85,000 kgs. A symbol of wealth and life, the fountain’s design is based on the Hindu Mandala, meaning universe, and is a symbolic representation of oneness in spirit and unity. The bronze ring further symbolises the equality and harmony of all races and religions in Singapore. We are very proud of what was accomplished, the finished structure is a testament to the dedication and skill of all of the James Coppell Lee team.  Get In Touch ",2274,362

Call216-251-2804Today. Zinc Die Casting Zinc is the most fluid of all alloys and because of its greater fluidity, die castings can be made thinner, more intricate, and more complex, eliminating the need for secondary operations. With less material being used in thin-wall applications, parts automatically become lighter, creating savings in material cost and energy—when melting and recycling. Zinc castings can be made to look like solid gold, weathered brass, stainless steel, and even leather.  Because of zinc’s density, cast zinc parts provide a feel of substance and durability that simply cannot be matched. Call216-251-2804today for more information!

Low melt alloys can expand up to 3.3% when solidifying from a liquid to a solid depending on the product.  This expansion allows these alloys to precisely conform to any intricate details when molded. CS Alloys is a modern facility with new equipment that enables us to offer our customers the most up to date and current methods of producing low melt alloys. CS Alloys is proud to offer over 100 different low melt alloys; and can produce customer specific items to meet specific customer needs.  Our products have a temperature melting range  between 100 to 483 degrees Fahrenheit.  We produce Low Melt items in various forms: Cakes, Extruded Bar, Wire, and Ingots. Our manufacturing facilities are right here in America (North Carolina) and we ship our products worldwide.  We are proud to help create jobs for Americans. Directions for bending thin walled tubing with CS Alloys Important: Satisfactory results depend entirely on rapid quenching and thorough cooling, re-warming before bending, and using a slow uniform pressure during the forming operation. (Rust-less iron or stainless steel are recommended for tank construction.  Plain steel will rust when in constant contact with boiling water and steam.  Copper, aluminum and galvanized iron tanks will contaminate the alloy). The approximate weight of CS Alloys per foot of tubing for various inside diameters is as follows: (CS Alloys weigh .34 lbs. per cubic inch) Do not clean tubes by pickling or any wet process, as retention of acid salts will interfere with development of a continuous oil film and increase tendency for CS Alloys to stick to tube wall. Modern motor oils contain detergents which tend to act as flux.  Straight run mineral oils, containing no detergents, are recommended.  Cities Service Coâs Amples-P2 has been found satisfactory.  Silicone DC-7 is excellent. An CS Alloys remaining in tube after following direction may be removed by blowing out with steam; dissolving in dilute Sulphuric or Hydrochloric Acid or Caustic Soda solution (start with 10% solution at 200 degrees F). Additional information on removing residual particles of CS Alloys is available on request. ALLOY SPECS Click here to view full specification table Download Specifications Sheet ",2788,446

Introduction|How to Reach Us!|Product ListingChart of Metal Composition Specifications|Atlas Bronze's 1903 catalog Introduction to Atlas Bronze Corporation The Atlas Bronze Corporation specializes in supplying bushings, bearings, bars, blocks and other non-ferrous parts. Atlas Bronze Corp offers a complete line of continuous, sand and centrifugally cast products in many bronze and brass alloys, even yellow brass. Atlas Bronze has trained engineers that are available for customer consultation in the event of problems specific to castings. We supply all non-ferrous alloys, aluminum, copper, lead and zinc-based. In addition to supplying and stocking numerous types of ""standard"" pieces, we are capable of supplying special runs. We supply general machine parts, such as gear blanks, pullies, valve bodies and brackets. The castings supplied by Atlas Bronze can be supplied, machined and ready for installation - i.e., plain bushings, flanged, split and half-bearings, all manufactured to engineering specifications. We also can do grooving and graphiting on any size bearing. Complete machining facilities are available to service your needs.  Go to top of the page Atlas Bronze is capable of supplying castings that weigh up to 10,000     lbs. in brass and bronze alloys and up to 300 lbs. in aluminum alloys.  Bearings can be     continuously cast to a 16"" maximum diameter, sand cast to 40"" (maximum diameter)     and centrifugally cast up to 76"" (maximum diameter). In order to produce the best possible casting for the job, a legible drawing or sketch of the piece should be made available to the foundry from which we will make a pattern. Patterns can be supplied to produce one piece only, or for long production runs.  Casting to shape can yield significant savings, in material costs as well as reduce machining time, even with the added cost of the pattern considered.  The finish required for a casting to machine smooth is usually an eighth of an inch     or less. Draft requirements should also be kept in mind. For continuous and centrifugal     castings it's not necessary to buy a pattern. Fully computerized job pricing allows a     quick answer to all pricing questions, quotations generally only take a few minutes to     complete.  The foundry maintains an extensive cross reference library of alloy specification,     from government specifications to obsolete manufacturer's trade names.  Certification of     ingots, chemical analysis and physical test reports can be furnished upon request.Atlas Bronze Corporation has been in business for over 90 years and that's a lot of experience in the bronze casting industry. Custom crafting and     ""non-standard"" order parts and materials are our specialty. We pay particular attention to quality and to getting the job done on time.

254," Skirt Liners Keech skirt liners are an adjustable wear liner used across a range of GET and industrial applications. Available in Keech high impact steels and white irons. Features a weld on adapter. Tapered to suit conveyors and apron feeders. Skirt Liners Keech Skirtliners are an adjustable, lightweight and easy to install wear liner used across a range of mining and industrial applications. Design features: Benefits: Uses: Why use Skirtliners? Skirtliners are used in a feed hopper along the bottom edge of the sidewall to stop dirt and rock that has dropped onto a belt or an apron feeder pan from spilling over the edge. Skirtliners form the shape of the belt load as the belt carries the material away, to ensure it is not overloaded and doesn’t spill over. Depending on the speed of the belt and the abrasiveness of the material it can be a high wearing area. It is desirable to have the bottom of the skirt liner running as close as possible to the passing belt because should a rock  lodge between the belt and the liner it can rip the belt  causing major disruption while it is repaired and costing a large amount to fix. For this reason it is important to be able to adjust the liner height. How do Skirtliners work? Keech Skirtliners can be changed out by one person and result in reduced shut down times. Maximum wear protection extends the life of valuable mining and industrial equipment.  Related Products Contact Us Follow Us Newsletter Email address:First Name:Last Name:  ",1496,257

255,"CSI Home CSI Matrix Metals Processes CSI Galleries CSI Team Contact Our Contact ALUMINUM All the aluminum we present to market is alloyed aluminum. Alloys vary by what the end need of the product is, but we can help you narrow your choices by understanding the end need of product.  TheMATRIXshows aluminum being castable by a variety of different processes with die cast, sand cast, permanent mold and investment cast being typical first stops. We'll walk you through how to decide again by understanding your end product need. ​ Typical needs of aluminum castings include: near net shape, high strength to weight ratio, fine surface finish, wear resistance, cost effective to other options. Each process noted on the MATRIX page has a high degree of dimensional stability with aluminum, as well as castable density run over run.  Solidification modeling is used extensively in tooling development no matter what process is chosen. This leads to ‘first shot’ success and limited resampling, once defined porosity is well controlled in any of the noted processes. ​ Tool life in Aluminum is excellent but does vary by process. Machinability inaluminum is another high point,with a low machine tool wear.  Production casting tooling can be had for as little as $4K and available for production in as little as 3 weeks.Aluminum castings can be painted,plated,polished, anodized.

255,"CSI Home CSI Matrix Metals Processes CSI Galleries CSI Team Contact Our Contact IRON Iron can be produced through powdered metal/MIM as well as through sand and investment casting. Sand casting is where most of the tonnage runs. Iron is heavily alloyed with the ability to cost effectively meet a slew of different product demands. Standard irons are gray and ductile grades which are used in automotive, heavy equipment, pumps etc….When looking at small net shape components considering powdered metal can be highly cost effective, while also gaining excellent surface finish and best near net shape. ​ High wear and abrasion resistance is another class leading area of iron often called the white irons. General toughness as well fatigue strength are other defining characteristics of iron castings. Chisel points, metering, ground engagement and mining are all categories where the white irons shine.  Iron products can be painted, plated and machined. Solidification modeling is readily used by iron foundries to precisely define mold and part development.

Steel components are produced via the powdered metal/MIM process, as well as sand and investment casting. High strength, toughness, abrasion and wear resistance are typical reasons for specing steel in your applications. ​ Per usual powdered metal gives you the finest surface finish and closest near net shape of the processes. Casting allows you to make 100k pound parts and beyond! ​ All typical secondary capabilities can be performed including paint, plating,polishing, heat treat and machining. Machining runs a bit slower due to the general toughness of the material. Production tooling follows the same path as the other noted materials we have been discussing.

259,"Mold Making To determine the kind of tooling needed to make your plastic part, you should know the estimated annual usage or EAU. Most parts that have an annual usage of more than 10,000 for simple geometry and 50,000+ or more on complex geometry are feasible. Just to clarify, some parts are produced in the millions yearly byplastic injection moldingwhile some highly specialized parts that can only be injection molded may be produced in very small lot sizes. EAU of 100,000+ are normal in the custom injection molding business range of 50-250 ton press capacities, but are not a prerequisite. A well-maintainedplastic injection moldcan continue to produce consistently accurate parts well beyond 10 years. Extremely intricate parts can be produced in mass at a low cost with a properly constructed mold. Some high wear materials such as glass fiber reinforced plastic may require hardened tool steel inserts. © 							2023Mountain Mold & Die, Inc. Powered by WordPress ",973,156
259,"Mold Design Mold Design:Our custom plastic injection mold design process involves accurate communication with thecustomer that defines their specific needs. This can be accomplished with the digital transfer of information, reverse engineering, drawings, specifications and standards. Then we design the digital model of the mold and analyze the model to optimize the performance of each mold to achieve the best results. Requirements:We will require your complete specifications, including: the geometry of the part, the material type or specification the part is to be molded from, the appearance and color requirements for the part, a tolerance standard such as ISO or DIN that is applicable to any dimensions not otherwise specified.

This is a natural progression that many custom plastic injection molding companies make. We may provide case studies depending on your product or business line. Innovative material properties–including chemical bonding in the over-molding process–now allows for elegant part geometry that was impossible with other means of attachment or assembly. We started using these materials as early as 1996 when a customer needed a solution for over-molding an automotive key that included a RFID transponder.Over the next several years, our ability to provide ingenious solutions made us an industry leader in this product line. © 							2023Mountain Mold & Die, Inc.

259,"Services Wire EDM Services Modern plastic injection mold making requires the use of CNC and Wire EDM technology to produce the many intricate inserts, cores, pins and blocks that make up the plastic injection mold. We have extensive experience in these fields as we have been milling 3-D surfaces since 1988. We also have the ability to Wire-Cut 5 axis profiles on metal parts up to 2,500 lbs., and up to 12 inches thick. We are not a high production wire-EDM shop that cuts 20-100 of the same parts each day, but we do have these unique capacities that we offer. MIG & TIG Welding Services Tool steel welding up to 4,500 lb. is available in our plant. Typically used for mold repair the most common type is H-13 tool steel. Some stainless tool steels can also be welded with excellent results. Most hot-work type tool steels “H-**” can be welded with excellent results. The geometry of the part and the area to be reconstructed generally define the effort required to successfully weld any workpiece. Many jobs require a preheat process to reduce the risk of cracking the workpiece. On most die steels, welding is not recommended as they often crack. If the work piece hardness is greater than 56, Rockwell “C” standard TIG welding is not advised. © 							2023Mountain Mold & Die, Inc. Powered by WordPress ",1309,227

While assembling  over 30 million transponder automotive keys in the past 20 years our  ability to eliminate restrictions to workflow have been honed to a  razor edge. We will typically improve the production rate of transferred  or converted lines by a significant amount, also reducing scrap and  improving measurable quality indicators. What sets us apart is that while we  were a contract manufacturing company assembling those 30 million RFID  keys for the automotive industry, our  expertise in assembly increased  dramatically. We never try to reinvent  the wheel, but we do maximize  the throughput of each process in a cost  effective manner. Based on results  during the past 15 years, when an  existing line or assembly cell has  been transferred to our facility, an  increase in production of 50-100% can be achieved. © 							2023Mountain Mold & Die, Inc.

264," About Us In 2003 the company Oceanie International 2000 began its operations by the delivery of a first container of T- posts. That same year, for their fence company and a few customers, the owners started to import accessories for fences. In 2009, after 14 years in the fence industry, the owners Claire Mandeville and Yves BÃ©rard sold their company ""ClÃ´ture Sorel-Tracy"" to keep only the import section via Oceanie International 2000. In 2011, facing a greater demand due to their customersâ loyalty, Oceanie International 2000 expands with the purchase of a distribution center of nearly 11,000 square feet. This warehouse can maintain a significant inventory of accessories for chain link fences, ornamental and railings, in order to increase their speed and delivery capacities. ",790,124

274,"  Welcome to""Advanced Space Manufacturing Systems"" (408) 775-5727 (408) 775-5727 ASMS, INC Welcome Develop advanced technologies to enable organizations for in-situ design and fabrication of products needed for space exploration.  Space exploration is dependent upon facilities located in orbit and throughout our solar system. The future space facilities will be more complex than the current International Space Station and are expected to be self-sustaining and self-sufficient in operation and communication with Earth.  Space station must have the capability for manufacturing, not only to repair and to replace parts of other space vehicles, but also to build components for larger structures.  Astronauts and space explorers must work in a self-sustained environment with capabilities for manufacturing of components and structures in support of missions or in case of an emergency when lives must be saved.  Development of an infrastructure to manufacture components in space has become a reality. Furthering this effort will lead to placing space factories in space orbits.  A self-contained Space Manufacturing Module could be equipped with:  Universal Configurable/Sliding Platform Module Machine Tool Production SystemRobotic Handling SystemLaser Machining SystemLaser Welding SystemAdditive ManufacturingAutomated Metrology SystemSafety Monitoring SystemsQuality Control  Materials would be delivered to the space Manufacturing system’s Manufacturing Module from Earth or other locations such as a space station or celestial body outposts/colonies.  Space Manufacturing Systems  The orbital heat loads, heat fluxes, and orbital conditions were simulated with computer software. Using typical methods of thermal protection including the use of Muli-layer Insulatio(MLI) and in circulation on the internal surfaces, the equipment on the module was kept in a desired temperature range at Low Earth Orbital conditions.  Advanced Thermal Research  It was also discovered that MLI works better as thermal protection insulation than Kevlar and Carbon Fiber alone. The Low Earth Orbit thermal protection system designed would also work for higher Earth orbits, such as a geosynchronous orbit.  Universal Manufacturing Module  The need to fabricate or assemble components is accomplished through the use of Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) methodology and practices.  In CIM Methodology, engineering data is shared through the use of CAD/CAE/CAM and are implemented concurrently internet of things (IoT).  Virtual Reality is used on Earth to verify the engineering design and data prior to it transmission to the module.  Published Papers and Patent Space Manufacturing Module System and Method A space based manufacturing system including a control module and a manufacturing module. The manufacturing module contains the tools required for automated processing of materials into finalized components. The control module allows command and control of the manufacturing module as well as communication with earth based systems. For component manufacture, the component requiring manufacture is identified in space, designed and engineered on earth, and manufactured in space using computer integrated manufacturing to tie these processes together. The astronaut in the control module monitors the safety of the manufacturing operation and may control manufacturing in real time.

284,"Ron Adamson Studio and Artworks Original Western Art About  Ron Adamson grew up next to the Kootenai River near the small lumber and mining town of Libby, Montana. His interest in art showed up at an early age as he painted the model airplanes and cars that he loved to assemble.  In particular, he wanted to save the plastic decals that came with the models and would instead paint the decal images onto the models. Ron learned to carve the bark of Cottonwood trees as a teenager and would eventually choose to illustrate characters from the local native and frontier culture.   He researched the clothing of trappers and settlers, and the traditional costumes of first nations people in order to represent them accurately. Ron began experimenting with acrylic paint at the end of his teen years.  One of his first significant works is shown at left; “The Birches”, 1975. Ron started working with bronze sculpture in the 1980’s.  Each step of the process takes a lot of time.  A clay model of the intended statue is only the beginning.  A rubber mold is made of the clay and provides a vessel where a wax replica of the clay model can be created.  From the wax replica a ceramic mold is made and used to finally cast the bronze.  In larger statues there can be many pieces cast separately that must then be cleaned up and welded together. Ron created his own foundry in 1990 to learn every step of bringing a bronze statue to life.  “Honkers” was the first bronze cast in Ron’s foundry.  It won the Best of Show sculpture award at the 1993 “Celebration of Western Art” show held each year in Puyallup, Washington. Ron started working with stone in the late 1980’s, primarily alabaster.  He produced several pieces awarded Best of Show in juried exhibitions across the Pacific Northwest.  In his most recent adventures Ron has returned to chainsaw carving, and working with much larger pieces of wood and carving tools.

284,"Ron Adamson Studio and Artworks Original Western Art The Story of Standin’ On The Corner.  “Easy” Winslow Arizona’s iconic statue.  It started with a web page. The Internet was new when I was 38 years old, and I saw the potential. Dr. Anthony Pages was behind the first internet provider in the remote town of Libby Montana. Dr. Pages was instrumental in developing “Kootenet.”The term “Information Super Hiway” captured my attention. My cousin Rocky Seelbach had returned from Guam, his background in the Navy was telecommunication. Rocky developed “Techline” in Aberdeen Washington, the towns first internet provider. Rocky showed me the potential of the World Wide Web at his home in Spokane. With the help of Kootenet, I soon learned how to created my own web page. It appeared that I introduced the first web page in North America offering art work for sale. It was a simpler internet back in 1996. In June my web site was born- www.ronadamson.com, and email became my newest promotional tool. In May of 1998 an email from Glenn and Yvonne Howeth arrived in my inbox, the Howeth’s lived in Winslow Arizona. A historic bronze sculpture began.  The project began in 1998, pictured is Janice Griffethof the Standin’ on the Corner Foundation.Serious promotion of “The Standin’ on The Corner Park” was beginning.  The “The Standin’ on the Corner Foundation” (SOTCF) made the decision,the artist to create the sculpturewould be Ron Adamson of Libby Montana. The SOTC approved this sculpture pictured below. It was now time to figure out how to create the life sized monumental bronze.This was a daunting task.The following images show the progress of how this iconic sculpture was born. After the sculpting was completed, the molding process begins.      On Location in Winslow Arizona, September of 1999. Thanks for following this story. Check back as this story is a work in progress.

334,"About Selmet Selmet Inc. is a worldwide leader in the manufacturing of titanium castings and machined parts for the aerospace industry. Located in Albany, Oregon, Selmet has evolved into a state-of-the-art investment casting foundry manufacturing parts for a variety of programs including the Boeing 737, Airbus A320, and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Selmet was founded by Larry Sharpf in 1983 after a successful career in the aerospace industry. Larry found he had discovered a unique casting process which allowed him to create his own company and compete in an industry dominated by a small group of other companies. This process lead to Selmet’s ability to compete with even the largest of manufacturers and work its way to becoming the only cast foundry to be awarded UTC Gold Supplier Status in 2012. In 2011, Selmet was purchased by Blue Point Capital Partners and has experienced major growth since then, expanding facilities from 130,000 square feet to over 220,000 square feet, and employing over 500 people in the Albany and surrounding areas. In 2014 and 2015, Selmet acquired machining companies Onamac Industries in Everett, Washington and Western Metrology in Wilsonville, Oregon, which have a combined 160 employees. Mission Selmet is a world-class supplier of titanium castings for the aerospace industry. Vision Our vision is to become the community leader in building products, relationships and jobs that last. Values Integrity, teamwork, strong work ethic, results-driven, and responsiveness. Continuous Improvement Selmet has been involved in Continuous Improvement for many years but in May, 2008 a renewed commitment was made that has transformed the company. This commitment was made by Selmet leadership and all of the 280 employees at that time to focus on our customers and provide industry leading value. The Lean Journey was moved into the fast lane and continues to accelerate and change Selmet for the better. July 2012 Selmet celebrated the completion of their 100th Kaizen Event since recommitting the organization to become “World Class”. Through the Strategic Planning/Policy Deployment process Selmet defines its operational goals, focuses resources and actions. Lean tools drive action based Kaizen eliminating waste and providing value to our customers. Lean tools are selected from our tool box, 5S, Value Stream Map, Cause & Effect, Process Mapping, Standard Work, Set-up Reduction, Total Productive Maintenance, 5 Whys, Linkage & Flow and others as needed to create a basis for action that delivers results. April of 2012, Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Engines, a division of United Technologies Corporation, recognized Selmet as a UTC Gold Supplier. Being the first raw material casting supplier to achieve Gold Supplier Status was a major milestone in Selmet’s Lean Journey. Our people know that much remains to be done and we have many opportunities for improvement awaiting us. Selmet remains committed to the identification of the least waste way and the uncompromising pursuit of identifying and eliminating waste. Our Lean Journey Continues!

340,"Know the part# you're looking for?Use our Interchange Search PV Data Chart PV Calculation PV is a means of measuring the performance capabilities of bearings. P is expressed as pressure or pounds per square inch on the projected area of the bearing. V is velocity in feet per minute of the wear surface (surface feet per minute). For sleeve (plain) bearings, the surface speed is .262 (pi ÷12) x RPM x shaft diameter in inches. P is equal to the load on the bearing in pounds divided by the projected area in square inches. For sleeve (plain)bearings, the projected area is the length x the inside diameter of the bearing. PV is then obtained by multiplying P x V as shown in the following example: 3/4"" shaft @ 341 RPM, 90 lb. total load, bearing length 1"". V = .262 x RPM x shaft diameter, or .262 x 341 x .750 = 67 sfpm. P = total load ÷ projected area (area = .750 x 1.0 = .75 sq. in.), or 90 lbs. ÷ .75 = 120 psi. PV = 120 psi x 67 sfpm = 8040 PV. Bunting Bearings PV Data Chart All values are based on 72° room temperature and the standard lubricant for the bearing in question. All of the V’s (and therefore the PV’s) can be raised by special lubricating techniques. follow us: associations: ",1199,228

Fill out the form below, or contact ourFabricated Gates Sales Manager, Rich Korbe. Fabricated Slide & Weir Slide Gates can be mounted to head walls or channels and are used in situations where cost effective flow control                     of water is desired. The gate slides up to permit the flow of water underneath the gate. Weir gates are designed to slide down in order to maintain upstream water levels or provide a better view of water                     flowing across the gate. Radial Radial gates (also known as Tainter gates) have a large convex surface which dams the upstream flow                     of water. The gate is supported by radial arms attached at either side that are mounted                     to trunnions which allow the gate to pivot up and down. This design allows economical construction                     and operation of gates which need to control the flow of water in large openings. Overshot Overshot gates (also known as pivoting weir gates) are used to control upstream water levels. In principal,                     they are similiar to a sliding weir gate, but instead of sliding down, the gate pivots on a hinge attached                     at the bottom of the gate. And More...

Most commemorative coins however are struck using ""Crown size"" specifications - 38.6mm diameter and approximately 25 grams weight. These issues can be produced specifically for the host country or we can enter into an agreement whereby these coins are produced by us and sold to our network of wholesalers and retailers worldwide, with the host country receiving a commission for each coin sold. Using this method, the host country incurs no costs or expenses. These coins are a useful tool in raising the profile of smaller countries, together with the added benefits of a likely increase in trade and tourism.  Stamps Our Philatelic Bureau has introduced the same marketing techniques we have perfected with our coin issues and use these to increase sales substantially for the host countries. We are able to give very competitive prices for regular issue stamps to be used for postage and if we become involved with commemorative issues, we will generally produce these and market them to our network of agents with a royalty paid for each stamp we sell. With this system, there are no costs incurred by the host country who are paid on a royalty basis. Printing costs can be expensive and we absorb all marketing and production costs so that our host countries have no risk and receive regular royalty payments from us. ",2632,436

Copper is also an industrial metal that possesses superior electrical and thermal conductivity, is easy to process and, through the incorporation of other metals, can deliver broad technical performance. This makes it a very important material in a wide range of consumer and industrial applications.    Gosberg Red Metal   Getting the Red Metal    Exploring the Antimicrobial Properties of Brass   Brass and other copper-containing alloys have been known for their bacteriostatic and sanitizing properties.    Antimicrobial Copper Alloys Group   List of EPA registered Antimicrobial Copper Alloys    Antimicrobial Properties of Copper   Copper based alloys contain “antimicrobial” properties that kill bacteria naturally and stainless steel can’t make that claim.

In fact Cronite designs, produces and assembles multiple carbon products at its Arnage plant in France. This ranges from graphite furnace parts to the most complex 3D CFC fixtures. The strength of the Cronite Group is to master the design and production of these products in  the different materials, refractory cast steel and CFC. Cronite Group’s design office and research and development center have developed a new generation of products combining the benefits of cast refractory steel and CFC. These are our hybrid fixtures. This technology is particularly effective for high-temperature, vacuum heat treatments and low-pressure carburizing process. The principle is simple. Combine the benefits of both material families to compensate for their weaknesses. And this to ensure the best lifespan of the product and at the best cost. Thus the CFC will be used to lighten the structure and make it more resistant. But only where it is needed. Cast refractory steel, due to the flexibility in the forms that can be made and by its cost, will constitute the rest of the design. The complex shape of the parts to be supported in a fixture can be complicated to make in CFC where a casting can be designed to a shape that perfectly fits the contours of the part to be treated. Similarly, not all structural elements require the use of CFCs. In many cases, for example, the base tray and vertical grids can remain cast steel. The example of ring gears fixtures for low-pressure carburizing illustrates the concept very well. This is just one example of the many custom bespoke combinations that the Cronite Group’s design office offers to its clients on a daily basis. It’s your turn to take the plunge and submit your projects to us. Opt for the best of each technology. Optimize your Total Costs of Ownership! Choose the Cronite hybrid fixtures!

433,"About Norwood Foundry Norwood Foundry operates out of Nisku, Alberta in western Canada. We take pride in our expert craftsmanship and quality. We are cutting edge and focused on bringing new technology and processes to our foundry, processes such as 3D scanning for example. We produce castings for forestry, agriculture, manufacturing, and oil and gas industries. We also specialize in producing custom castings. We manufacture high quality aluminum, brass and bronze castings for signs, recognition plaques, light poles and bases, tree grates, and all other infrastructure needs. Our castings range in size anywhere from 1 pound to 7000 pounds. Our network of contacts makes it possible for us to access and import all kinds of metals and alloys and to provide outstanding quality at prices that cannot be matched. We also operate a municipal waterworks distribution center. Norwood Foundry Limited is a privately owned and operated corporation that understands the importance of excellent customer service. It is our goal to ensure complete customer satisfaction, from the time we embark on a project to completion. Norwood Foundry was founded in 1905 in Edmonton, Alberta. Five years after it had been established, Norwood was bought by Ernest Buker, who operated the business for fifty years. In the early days of Norwood, there was an agricultural focus on the products that were produced, namely cast iron. After world war one, production expanded into stove and furnace parts, as well as municipal castings. During the second world war there was growing demand for business and the company expanded, leading to the purchasing of Garvie Bolton Foundry and Coutts Machinery Company Ltd. In 1950, Norwood bought the Edmonton Foundry, resulting in the operation of plants at three different sites. To streamline operations, the Garvie Bolton plant was closed in 1952 and amalgamated with one of the other locations. The Norwood plants produced cast iron castings as well as brass and aluminum work. In 1978 a new plant opened in Nisku. The modern facility produced castings in high-alloy irons, which were melted in electric induction furnaces. The oil industry was thriving, and was a primary market for Norwood. Norwood also produced virtually all the castings for the waterworks industry. In 1992, an addition was made to the Nisku plant, which lead to the closure of the original operation on 91st Street and 111th Avenue. At that time, the location had been operating for seventy years and was very well integrated into the community. The closure of the operation was headline news. Presently, Norwood has been operating for 115 years and continues to produce castings for the construction, industrial, manufacturing, and oil and gas industries. Today we are dedicated to serving all of Western Canada’s infrastructure needs with expertise, quality craftsmanship, and excellent customer service, just as we have been for the past six generations.

433,"Associations The Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta The Government of Alberta uses self-governance to regulate the engineering and geoscience professions. This means that professional engineers and geoscientists, instead of a government organization, regulate the professions. It is through the Engineering and Geoscience Professions Act (EGP Act) that the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA) was created. APEGA is the regulator that makes sure engineering and geoscience professionals in Alberta carry out their work according to the requirements in the Act. American Foundry Society The mission of the American Foundry Society is to advance the success of its members and the metalcasting industry through advocacy, education, and innovation. The Red Deer Construction Association exists to serve its’ members; by displaying plans and information on current projects in the industry; by acting as their collective voice on issues of concern; and by promoting standards, education, and communication in an effort to benefit the industry and society. If a business has been accredited by the BBB, it means BBB has determined that the business meets accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB accredited businesses pay a fee for accreditation review and monitoring for continued compliance and for support of BBB services to the public. Formed in 1976, the Nisku Business Association provides a unified voice for businesses in the Nisku Industrial Park and surrounding area. Managed by a volunteer Board of Directors, the NBA is a membership funded organization. The Nisku Business Association has successfully taken action upon matters such as: telephone rates, postal services, police/fire protection, road construction and property taxes. The NBA promotes the Nisku Industrial Park through business and social functions, publications and projects. In addition to these advantages, the NBA also offers its members an Association Group Benefits program. The ARHCA is the largest heavy construction association in Canada. We represent contractors who work on the construction and rehabilitation of highways, municipal roads, bridges, sewer, and water projects, as well as the suppliers (such as equipment dealers, finance companies, aggregate suppliers, law firms, etc.), and consulting engineers who work with them. ARHCA member companies can also be found constructing streets, curbs and gutters, sewer and water systems, and other infrastructure for residential, commercial, oilfield, oil sands and forestry projects.

454,"Large, Complex Castings Skilled craftspeople take your largest designs and safely produce impressive, quality castings. In the world of modern manufacturing, removing “skill” from the production equation is a highly sought-after ideal, in order to drive labor costs down. For castings produced on our Floor, this simply isn’t economical without high production quantities supporting the need for automation. Due to this reality, much of our competition is either unwilling or unable to mold in this manner. We have both green sand and no-bake capabilities to ensure we can provide the appropriate service for you. Green sand is the most cost effective but more complex, tighter tolerance or visually critical parts can be produced in no-bake sand to better control geometry and/or surface finish. As with Roto-lift molding, lead times for raw castings produced on The Floor flow around the 16-20 week range, due to the time required to produce a single casting coupled with the fact that we are an industry leader in this area.

454,"Advantages Advantages of Aluminum Sand Casting Process The sand casting process offers many distinct advantages when compared to alternative metal casting methods. When the versatility, unit costs, quality, availability and all other factors are considered, using sand molds for manufacturing aluminum castings is the clear choice. Aluminum parts cast in sand molds, and which will be machined, are highly competitive with gray iron, notwithstanding the higher cost per pound of material. The following represents some of the clear advantages of the aluminum sand casting process. Flexibility of DesignIntricately cored parts and parts with feet, bosses or other unwieldy protuberances can be cast soundly. Wide Range of Alloys and Properties AvailableProperties range from 16k to 50k tensile with varying degrees of machinability, corrosion resistance, etc. Lowest Tooling Cost – Shortest Lead TimeUnmachined patterns are cheaper and faster to build lower overall the overall cost of casting production and shortening turn-around time. Long Tool LifeThe aluminum sand casting process uses expendable molds. Hot metal, which causes deterioration of permanent-mold tooling and adversely affects quality of the cast parts, never touches the tooling (pattern). High Production Rates for Large Range of PartsThe many molding options available to sandcasters, from squeeze jolt machines to high pressure automatic molding machines, combined with the use of multi-impression matchplates, permits the manufacture of thousands of parts per day. Ease of Product ModificationWith shorter “Life of Product” cycles than in the past, the ease of altering tooling is increasingly important. Least Sensitive Gating, Feeding and Heat Removal System in Mass ProductionPouring temperatures in permanent molds should be held to +/- 20° for optimum results. In sand, good castings can normally be obtained with temperature differences as high as +/- 40% and generally in a much lower temperature range. High Density Molds Produce Good Surface FinishHigher mold squeeze pressures combined with technological improvements in sand preparation produce castings with a surface finish that rivals the permanent mold processes.

454,"Roto-Lift Molding  Perfect for Medium Size Sand Castings For castings larger than our 32 x 32” Sinto can produce, we have two semi-automatic Roto-lift molding centers to ensure many larger castings can be safely produced with production-line quality and efficiency. The weight, core complexity/placement and specific dimensions of your design dictate whether the Roto-lift is a good fit. If you have the opportunity to view a great operator mold on a roto-lift, I recommend you take it; it is one of those tasks in life that an experienced, prideful individual can make look easy but, somehow, you recognize that isn’t the case without ever having molded yourself. Due to our reputation in this area and a significant backlog regardless of market conditions or time of year, lead times for raw castings produced on our Roto-lifts are typically in the 8-12 week range. Flask sizes ranging from 18”x24” through 32”x70” extend the capabilities across a broad range of configurations. Typically, castings produced on our roto-lifts range from 30-100 pounds.

457,"219-362-8531 The Shell Mold Process  Hiler Industries boasts two modern foundries that produce millions of castings every year â all using the shell mold process. Since 1946, we have been providing our customers the highest quality castings, in a variety of metals, all with an excellent surface finish and near-net shape. Superior Machining QualitiesA major benefit of shell molding is the excellent machining characteristics achieved through this process. Many photomicrograph inspections have shown that shell castings have what might be termed âcooling rate inversion.â Unlike green sand castings, permanent mold and die castings â which all have hard skins and âsoftâ interiors â shell mold castings have âsoftâ skins and hard or dense interiors. As a result, shell mold castings have superior machining qualities vs. green sand and other types of castings. Less WeightAnother major benefit is that less machining stock is required. Over the years, we have found that .060 stock is more than ample. In fact, if the job were to be machined in our machine shop, we would add only .040 stock. This is helpful in two ways: There have been times when we worked with customers and eliminated machining entirely. General Tolerance Information(Unit of Measure: Inches) Same side of parting line: Add Â± .003 / inch over 3"" Across parting line: Â± .030 for 1st 3"" Â± .003 / inch over 3"" Draft: Typically 1Â° Certain applications at 0Â° draft. Typical Finish Stock: .060"" maximum Hole size cast into part: DIAMETER DEPTH Less than 0.5"" Equal to diameter 0.5"" - 1.0"" Equal to 1.5 times diameter  Note: The above information is modified by the individual casting complexity and to agreement between the customer and Hiler Industries. For example, we have held some dimensions to Â± .010, obtained less than 1Â° draft, and used some finish allowances less than .030. 219-362-8531sales © 2021 Hiler Industries. All rights reserved.

HISTORY In October of 1953 Chicago Magnesium Casting Company was founded by Donald R. Burnett after finishing his service in the navy and graduating from the University of Illinois with a degree in metallurgy. The business began in a small one room cinder block building on a plot of land just south of Chicago in suburban Blue Island.  By 1959 the company out grew that original dirt floor building and the current site was built. The company grew in the sixties and seventies fueled by such companies as Sundstrand, Westinghouse and General Electric.  Expansion occurred, adding additions and new buildings every year and has grown to nearly 150 employees and a customer base that includes Boeing, United Technologies, and Honeywell.  Since 1953 Chicago Magnesium has been at the forefront of magnesium and aluminum sand casting. Chicago Magnesium was the first foundry in the world to supply production castings in magnesium sand casting alloy WE43. Revolutionary at the time, this high strength corrosion resistant alloy developed by Magnesium Elektron offers excellent elevated temperature mechanical properties up to 480 degrees F. The alloy is targeted at applications such as helicopter and aero engine transmission cases.

487,"Cylinder Blocks Our rebuilt cylinder blocks go through a thorough 8-step process that provides high quality and product longevity.  You won’t find a better-quality re-manufactured block anywhere! We service Caterpillar, Detroit Diesel, Cummins, Waukesha, White Superior and International cylinder blocks. We also maintain a large supply of the most popular castings for immediate exchange in case of emergency.     Coastal casting align bores the block or frame and can laser check most blocks or frames. We will give a report showing your alignment results.  Repairing the Upper and lower O Ring areas    Block Reconditioning Procedures 1. Full rebuild (Zero Hour)2. Custom Machine Work3. Special Instructions Full Rebuild consists of the following 8 step process: Step 1: Identify the Block Each block is identified with a Coastal Casting work order number(usually a 4-5 digit number with the letter”B” at the end). This number is usually near the serial number. Step 2: Cleaning & Inspection The block is stripped of any non essential parts and is placed in a caustic soda vat overnight. The unit is then steam cleaned and water jacket sandblasted if necessary. Finally, the block undergoes a comprehensive 100% wet magnaflux inspection by a NDT trained professional. Step 3: 1st Visual Inspection A Coastal Casting block specialist will review the entire unit and document any issues that may arise. During this phase of the inspection, our specialist will focus on the integrity of seal areas, decks, water passages and bolt holes. Step 4: Align Bore Evaluation During this phase of Coastal Casting’s 8 Step Block Procedure a block specialist will evaluate and document the condition of the cam, main bores, cap fit, thrust, alignment and centerline. Incorrect centerline or over-sized bores are then corrected using the ABS approved spray weld process. Step 5: Vertical Machine Work During this phase the decks, liner seat areas and lower seal areas are addressed. Fitted interference inserts are then installed and re-machined true in the original location. We then mill the decks as minimally as absolutely possible in order to achieve acceptable cleanup. If low decks are identified they can be corrected using the METCO spray weld process. All areas are machined in accordance with the factory re-manufactured guidelines. Step 6: Detailing The block is then thoroughly cleaned, all gaskets are polished and the unit receives a final wash. Step 7: Final Inspection At this stage, a comprehensive inspection is performed on all vital elements and dimensional readings are recorded to verify unit accuracy. We then create a final report that is to be stored on file with CCS and issued alongside the block during final delivery. An optional laser alignment report can also be obtained in most cases. If a laser alignment report is requested, one of Coastal Casting’s certified Ludeca Laser System operators will perform all necessary testing and reporting. Step 8: Paint, Crate, & Shrink Wrap Once the block has passed our rigorous inspection process it is painted, preserved, packaged in a crate with a sturdy 2×4 base and a 1×12 top that covers the decks, banded and shrink wrapped. Custom Machine Work Custom machine works usually consist of first 5 steps of the rebuild process and we repair only what is not serviceable. Special Instructions Special Instructions apply only when the customer has dictated what needs to be repaired. The customer will be fully responsible for the condition and the integrity of the block in all other areas that we will not be focusing on. However, if we happen to notice something else, we will bring it to the attention of the customer at once. We are not responsible for any charges that are involved if we should, for example, be completed with the align bore job that we were instructed to perform and then find a crack elsewhere in the block. Most likely, if the block would need welding, then the align bore would require more attention afterwards, which would be of considerable more expense to the customer. We are glad to perform any of the details as outlined above. We communicate thoroughly with the customer regarding both Special Machine Work and Special Instructions. We want to achieve customer satisfaction and, in the event of Special Machine Work or Special Instructions, many questions may be necessary to make sure you can visualize what we understand you to want. Zero Hour is the easiest for us because there is no window for misinterpretation, but we understand that not all jobs call for the attention that is required to render Zero Hours. We can supply you with the best rebuilt blocks or the best custom work available. We are able to do this by quality control. quality control and more quality control. Note in the step-by-step procedures the different steps that we take to check and double check.It is our goal to supply components that are ready to install. Brand “X” components usually require much attention from the mechanic to “make it work”. Not ours – just wash off the preservative, insure that oil galleys are clean, install all plugs in the proper places and build your engine. Our components can be assembled as if they were new. Your mechanics will recognize the ease of assembly and appreciate this aspect of our work. You will recognize longevity that properly reconditioned blocks have to offer.

494,"Design & Process Guidelines When designing a casting, active participation should take place between the Design Engineer, the casting producer and the machining source. Meloon Foundries LLC does this through direct contact with the casting buyer. Pattern or ToolingA significant variable in the construction of a pattern is the determination of the shrink factor. The shrink factors vary for different metals and also the configuration of the part. The number of impressions, the gating system, the process or methodology will affect the casting cost. This is better left to the foundry and pattern maker to determine. Process GuidelinesIt is important that the foundry and the casting purchaser work closely together in order for the casting producer to make an acceptable cost effective part. Producing a casting for the first time entails a certain amount of trial and error.It is an experienced-based development process. The expertise and past experience with similar casting configurations provide a guideline for the initial production. Usually the more intricate the casting design and the more drastic the change in section thickness the less predictable the casting soundness.This is why it is important to consider location of isolated heavy sections, uniform wall thicknesses and correct placement or ribs and junction design. Visual casting soundness many times is not sufficient to verify acceptability and machining the sample casting prior to production release is important. SpecificationsOver specifying can increase the cost of a casting appreciable. Proper alloy selection, welding permissibility, correct choice of temper, and final inspection criteria all figure into casting cost.Under specifying leads in many cases to misunderstanding between the casting producer and the casting supplier. Castings that are designed for critical applications require specific quality criteria. Selection of material that does not meet environmental or mechanical properties frequently leads to poor casting performance. New Jobs Rapid PrototypingRapid Prototyping is the developing of a temporary pattern or tooling from a 3-D computer design. This temporary tooling reduces casting time from months to days. The computer model is used as the blue-print and its dimensions to produce a model. Any rapid prototype pattern that is durable enough to withstand green sand or no bake molding can be used. There are several rapid prototyping processes and the selection depends on the application. ",2501,373

506,"High-quality Products Manufacturing, done better. Kabert Industries provides the necessary resources for companies to maketheirproducts the best they can be. Fiberglass Cloth Since 1979 Kabert Industries has been weaving fiberglass cloth in Lynn, Indiana for the aluminum industry.  Fiberglass cloth is an inexpensive and effective method of non-ferrous molten metal distribution and filtration.  Kabert Industries cloth is available in a variety of styles.  Plain weave is a simple weave where the warp yarns run over and under the fill yarns.  Similarly, twill weave consists of the warp yarns running over two or more fill yarns.  The leno weave style interlocks the warp yarns, which cross over each other and join together with the fill yarns.  Also, three, four and six strand cloths are available.  All of Kabert Industries cloth is woven to specification on approximately 100 linear yard rolls.  Standard widths are obtainable for each style.  Minimum orders may apply on some widths.  Standard or brown finishes are available. Gaskets Gaskets are an inexpensive method of sealing and insulating troughs. Fiberglass insulation is die or hand cut to any specification gasket. Gaskets can be sewn onto fiberglass trough socks to filter out large impurities upstream so they will not break the sniff nozzle and downstream so they will not block the control pin. The temperature prior to breakdown is 600 to 700 degrees F. Fiberglass insulation is available in a variety of thickness and densities. Density:    2 LB, 3 LB, 4 LB, 6 LB Thickness:  1/2"", 3/4"", 1"" Vacuum Formed Shapes Kabert Industries vacuum formed shapes are produced by dewatering a slurry of Fiberfrax Bulk Ceramic Fibers and special high temperature binders.  This manufacturing method permits considerable freedom to vary shape, thickness, density and hardness.  Often the vacuum casting technique provides the most economical answer to producing large quantities of parts in simple or complex configurations.  ADVANTAGES OF VACUUM FORMED SHAPES High temperature stability Low thermal conductivity Low heat storage Lightweight Thermal shock resistant High heat reflectance Excellent corrosion resistance  CHEMICAL PROPERTIES Our vacuum formed shapes resist attack from the most corrosive agents.

This high ductility aluminum alloy is perfect for applications where high ductility is required. Additional benefits include superior corrosion resistance and excellent plating and anodization properties. The table below summarizes the relative performance of these materials compared to the 356 series. Relative ratings (1=excellent, 2=good, 3=fair, 4=poor) From Table 1 it is easily recognized that 356-T6 suffers from poor dimensional stability while 356-T51 has poor machining characteristics. Both of these alloys also suffer from medium corrosion resistance and weak anodization properties. These drawbacks limit design flexibility and performance while increasing costs. In comparison, HyDuct5™provides excellent properties for applications where high ductility is demanded. This alloy can also be used in marine applications where corrosion resistance is a must, and its anodization appearance make it an excellent choice for cosmetic parts. The one limitation of this alloy is applications where pressure or vacuum tightness is required. Contact Us Mon – Fri: 8:00 am – 4:00 pm (413) 283-2976 Follow Us ",1306,186

By heating the metal internally (instead of from the ladle surface), immersion heaters are able to heat the metal (from 300 lbs to 25,000 lbs) more rapidly and uniformly. The first of its kind in the United States, the two 15 kW immersion heaters manufactured by Lethiguel in France allow an 80% reduction in energy, compared to their existing resistance ladles. Solar Energy The processes involved with the manufacture of aluminum castings consumes a significant amount of electrical and natural gas resources.  With the rising energy costs that were particularly prevalent in the Northeastern United States, Palmer Foundry looked at how they could reduce energy costs in their manufacturing process as well as become involved in the push for more green and sustainable manufacturing.  In 2014, Palmer Foundry installed a 312.5 KW solar field on a portion of its nine-acre campus.  The solar installation has provided hundreds of thousands in utility savings, as well as significantly reduced the carbon footprint of Palmer Foundry.  On an average year, Palmer Foundry generates 18% of its total electrical demand from its own solar field.  We believe in promoting American manufacturing while also striving to be a participant in the push for sustainability for decades to come and our solar field is an excellent example of this achievement. Sand Reclamation In an effort to become more environmentally friendly, reduce virgin sand usage and lower costs, Palmer Foundry installed a thermal reclamation sand system in 2003 allowing the recovery and recycling of over 20 million pounds of sand a year. Further, the sand reclamation process has reduced the demand for additional chemical binder systems, and therefore, further reduces the foundry’s environmental impact.

As you read our history, you’ll see the common threads of engineering smarts, ingenuity, hard work, and customer dedication… In the 1940’s, Roderick Jensen served his apprenticeship and became a journeyman patternmaker with a reputation for precision work. With the skill and dexterity essential to the tooling trade, he also recognized that patterns could lead to repeat business in a foundry. He and his wife Evelyn started Palmer Foundry in a cinder block garage on Pleasant Street in Palmer, Massachusetts in 1951. In 1960, Rod and Evelyn built a new facility and moved the foundry to its present location on Mt. Dumplin Road where they worked together to expand the business. When Rod passed away in 1973, Evelyn became President of Palmer Foundry until her retirement in 1981. In 1976, Rod and Evelyn’s son, Frank, joined his mother at Palmer Foundry and engineered the company’s marketing of high quality aluminum castings toward New England’s fast growing high-tech instrument market. Frank’s wife, Carol, soon joined him at the foundry, followed by his two daughters, Beth and Lori, establishing the next generation of management at Palmer Foundry. As Evelyn moved toward retirement, Carol took on the responsibility for the company’s financial management. Together, Frank and Carol expanded the business to 60 employees. In the year 2000, Frank and Carol sold the company to Dave and Bob Logan. The Logan brothers have leveraged Dave’s entrepreneurial and financial instincts and Bob’s mechanical engineering and management skills to usher in Palmer Foundry’s latest era of innovation and achievement. The Palmer Foundry of today produces aluminum castings that are recognized and trusted worldwide for meeting the most demanding specifications. In July of 2020, Dave Logan’s son, Rob, assumed the role of President and ushered in a second generation of Logan family stewardship at Palmer Foundry.  Rob has worked to assemble a dynamic team for the next decade and is excited to lead Palmer Foundry’s efforts to install automation and bring Palmer into the 21st century of manufacturing excellence.

As soon as we receive a cylinder from a customer,itr gets inspected and estimated, typically within 24 hours and as soon as 60 minutes in special situations. We talk to the customer to determine lead time requirements and will work overtime or weekends to meet a rush delivery. If necessary, we will send a team to the customer’s plant to see first-hand what is happening. Or if needed, we will actually do the repairs in their shop to avoid lengthy disassembly and shipping. Our goal is to respond as quickly and effectively as possible to solve the problem.  Once we receive an approval from the customer, the cylinder is sent into the shop for repair and/or rebuild. Our software keeps a complete history of all work on every cylinder we repair, so the past work is communicated to the shop floor. The applications engineering team then determines the machining, plating, coating, sprays or blend of the three that will restore the cylinder to top operating condition.  Once the repairs are complete and the cylinder passes final inspection, the shipping is tracked until the roller is in the customer’s shop and back in production.

Case Studies In finishing before topcoat Repaired and ready to run Challenge:A medium-sized carton printer in the Midwest recently experienced extensive damage to its impression, blanket and plate cylinders caused by a hold down breaking and falling into the press, rendering the press inoperable. The printer had heavy production schedules to meet and needed to get back in operation quickly, so they called Hadronics for emergency repairs.  Solution:Hadronics application engineer visited the printer to see the problem first hand. After examining the press and talking to the production personnel, it was determined that the cylinders could be repaired on the press by using a combination of welding, hand work and portable plating. The repairs were completed and the press was back in operation in just one week , compared to two months that would have been necessary if the cylinders had to be pulled from the press.

532,"Engineering Combining Innovative Engineering with Years of Hands-On Experience to Improve Your Efficiency The applications engineering team at Hadronics is committed to continuously improving the efficiency of your rollers, cylinders and overall operations through constant innovation. When you send a roller to Hadronics, we first do a detailed visual inspection of the unit to determine the extent of the damage. We then look at the history of repairs for that cylinder and customer to gain more insight into possible solutions. The customer is contacted and interviewed to determine the cause of the problem and to review the operations surrounding the particular cylinder and the turnaround time needed.  Once the engineering team has gathered all the background information, we decide on the machining, plating, coating, sprays or blend of the three that will restore the cylinder to top operating condition. Hadronics strives to actually improve the wear characteristics, durability and efficiency of the cylinder by taking steps to widen the operational window of the cylinder to provide more flexibility in manufacturing. Before returning the cylinder to the customer, Hadronics does a detailed final inspection to ensure the concentricity, orbital rotation, surface finish and all other parameters are within specifications.

Whether aluminum, steel, or a copper-based alloy your casting project will be in good hands with our experienced engineers and project managers. Design Flexibility: Castings can be manufactured with complex features, including interior cavities, complex passageways, three-dimensional contours, thin walls, holes, and undercuts, eliminating the need for expensive assembly of multiple parts. Close Tolerances: Investment castings typically hold tolerances of .003” – .005” per inch, reducing the need for many secondary machining operations. Surface Finish: Due to the smooth surface of the wax pattern and the fine grain of the stucco or plaster used to create the mold, investment castings will have a surface finish of 125 RMS or better, with finishes as good as 63 RMS possible. Consistency: The investment casting process allows for a great deal of consistency and repeatability within the drawing tolerances of the final product. Investment Casting Are Cost-Effective: A single casting can replace complicated and often expensive fabricated parts and weldments. By incorporating many functional features into one casting, cost reductions can be obtained. Machining costs can be reduced by the tight tolerances that are held in the as-cast part. Investment castings also have low initial tooling costs as compared to other production methods. Alloy Selection: Depending on the function of the designed part, investment castings can be produced using a variety of alloys, including aluminum, steel, nickel, cobalt, or bronze. No other casting process offers as wide a range of alloys. Economic Order Quantities: Investment castings can be produced in numbers ranging from individual prototype runs to long production runs. There is no need to produce tens of thousands of castings to make the process affordable. Quick Turnaround: Protocast JLC can produce tooling and first article castings in as little as four weeks, with production runs completed in as little as four weeks following sample approval. Prototype castings can be produced as quickly as 5 days. Request A Quote Get in touch with us and send some basic info about your project. Footer Social Connect with us. Contact Navigation ",2386,356

536,"Protocast JLC Precision Investment Casting Stainless Steel Investment Casting April 6, 2017ByPam List Stainless Steel Investment Casting Stainless steel is one of the mostpopular alloy classificationsutilized in the investment casting process. Parts cast in stainless steel provide outstanding strength, as well as excellent corrosion and wear resistance without the need for additional processing or plating. This alloy class is also well known for its excellent machinability and aesthetic appearance. The number of stainless steels available allows for a wide range of mechanical properties, magnetic permeability, and heat resistance, giving the customer the option to choose an alloy that will perfectly fit their needs. Protocast JLC will produce stainless steel investment castings that meet your every requirement. From basic geometry to complex cores and extremely thin walls, we have the experience needed to provide solutions to your design and manufacturing difficulties. Common Alloys Poured Austenitic Stainless Steel Cast 300 series alloys are one of the most popular families of stainless steel used in industry. These alloys have excellent corrosion resistance, but cannot be hardened by heat treat. Martensitic Stainless Steel The addition of carbon causes cast 400 series alloys lose a portion of austenitic’s corrosion resistance, but the ability to harden the alloy through heat treatment ultimately yields stronger castings. These alloys have the ability to retain hardness, shape, and precision under extreme temperatures and conditions. Martensitic Stainless Steel – Precipitation Hardened These high-quality stainless steels combine the excellent corrosion resistance of the austenitic types with the ability to be hardened by heat treatment, providing a high tensile strength and hardness.

536,"Protocast JLC Precision Investment Casting Bronze Investment Casting April 6, 2017ByPam List Bronze Investment Casting Bronze is a copper-based alloy with a diverse range of characteristics that make it an excellent choice for a myriad of applications. Bronze alloys are resistant to corrosion and metal fatigue. The alloy can be very strong, but as the alloy’s tensile strength increases, its castability decreases. A commonly used bronze alloy for investment castings is aluminum bronze, which has both good tensile strength and good ductility, making it useful for high-stress and high-impact applications. Another popular bronze alloy is silicon bronze, which is best known for its use in art castings due to its desirable yellow hue. However, the silicon content of the alloy also provides self-lubricity while maintaining the natural strength of bronze, making it a perfect fit for many valves and bearing applications. Several industries have found the good mechanical properties and characteristics of bronze alloys useful for many applications.Some of the typical uses include pumps, valves, bearings, bushings, impellers, propellers, hydraulic components, marine castings, and art castings.

Once we’re both sure we know exactly what you want, we’ll move on to the next step. Pick Your Hardware Duluth Brass Drums only makes shells and rims (for now). That means you’re going to need to supply a few of your own parts. We arrange for you to send us one of your tuning lugs, your snare strainer & butt plate, and vent grommet (if you have one). We use your parts to ensure that all holes are drilled with 100% perfect spacing. There’s no do-overs with a lathe! The Pour We have your ideas, we have your hardware. Now it’s time for us to begin the build. We start by preparing a cast mold for your shell. The foundry team pours the super-heatedbronze alloyinto the cast. We allow at least 24 hours to cool, then the casting is removed from the mold. Each drum casting can weigh as much as fifty pounds when this step is completed. The Machining After cooling, the shells move into the machining process. Here, material is removed from the shell to bring the shell thickness down to your specifications. Finishing Touches After machining, your shell moves over to the mill where we cut in snare beds (if desired), drill mounting holes for your lugs and snare strainer, and drill a vent hole. Final Inspection It’s been a long road to get this far. Typical build times are 6-7 weeks, as drums are created in batches and need to be scheduled in with other jobs at the foundry. In this last stage we perform a final inspection, comparing the finished product to your specifications one final time to ensure everything is 100% correct. Shells and rims are very carefully packed in heavy-duty containers (along with the hardware you sent us earlier) and shipped to your address. Okay, enough reading. It’s time that we start building your ideal shell. Head over to ourRequest a Quotepage to start the process. Don’t know exactly what you want or have questions?

542,"What type of brass is right for you? CA907 / “Bell Bronze” CA907 is the “original” brass used in the manufacturing of drums, and is frequently referred to as bell bronze. This alloy is created from 90% copper and 10% tin. The finished product has a deep bronze coloring, but will have some “smudging” from it’s final tooling. That effect can be seen from above, but isn’t this noticeable in-person. CA954 / “Aluminum Bronze” CA954 is our newer drum alloy. It’s made from roughly 84% copper, 11% aluminum and 5% iron. This alloy isn’t as common for drum making, but we like the way the finished product looks. It has a very even, consistent finished look that takes on a brushed appearance.  We haven’t been able to identify a difference in sound between the two alloys!

542,"Chose your rims Select from either our Standard or Heavy rims. Both are created from the same CA954 material and are machined in-house. They are available in 13” or 14” sizes, and can be finished with either 8, 10, or 12 lugs (or whatever other number of lugs you want!). Standard Rims These are the rims that we’ve been producing since the beginning. They are machined from pieces of extruded CA954 brass, and feature weight-saving cutouts between lugs. Snare-side rims feature cutouts for your snare wires. Heavy Rims We also offer a “heavy” version of our rims. These are similar to standard rims, but we don’t remove the material between lugs. The result is a rim that weighs in at close to twice the weight as our standard rims.

Johnson (Dallas, TX) Location of Swearing In of President Lyndon B. Johnson (Dallas, TX) On November 22nd, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in approximately 128 minutes later aboard Air Force One. Lady Bird Johnson and Jacqueline Kennedy witnessed the first female Federal Judge Sarah T. Hughes administer the Oath of Office to Lyndon B. Johnson as the plane sat atDallas Love Field, awaiting to return President Kennedy’s body to Washington, DC.The swearing-in of President Johnson took only 28 seconds. This was the first and only time a U.S. President was sworn in aboard a Presidential aircraft. Questions concerning the line of Presidential succession led to the creation of the 25th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The succession of power occurs rarely in modern history. It was first used 10 years later as Congressman Gerald R. Ford was appointed Vice President after Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned his office. Emmy Award winning Historian Farris Rookstool, III hired A.R.K. Ramos to cast two bronze markers commemorating the exact location where President Lyndon B.Johnson was sworn in aboard Air Force One.

573,"About  Serving Industry Since 1912 In 1912, Mr. John Norwell Sr., a recent arrival from Europe, started what was then called Universal Brass Foundry Company. His first job in the United States was in a local Chicago foundry where he learned the trade.  His son, John Norwell Jr., joined his father moving into the 2nd generation and expanding the foundry operation into manufacturing brass and aluminum castings for plumbing and decorative uses.  Later, John junior's son Rodney joined the operation with an academic background in casting metallurgy from the University of Illinois Chicago.Joining Rod was James Hartman with a background in sales and management skills. This 3rd generation of partners sought new markets and began specializing in high Nickel alloy and Stainless Steel castings for the Food, Dairy, and Valve Manufacturing industries.  To meet the demanding requirements of these special alloys High-temperature Induction furnaces were acquired.  As Universal grew successful in these new ventures Keir Norwell and Brett Hartman joined as a 4th generation of leaders and partners in the company.  In over a century of business Universal Electric Foundry has become a fixture of high quality industry in Chicago’s near-west side and as a long family tradition of skilled metal casters. with over 100 years in the casting businessuniversal pours over 60 TYPES OF METALSwith experience and expertise Request a Quote Do you need a personalized service for your business?

579,"EAF At Tallman Technologies, we combine in-depth experience in the engineering, design and manufacturing of industrial copper components with steelmaking process experience and expertise. Together with a centrifugal casting process unique to the industry, state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling, SolidWorks™3D design and modeling software, and multi-axis CNC manufacturing, Tallman Technologies provides a complete solution to the steel mill for their water cooled copper requirements.. Products Tallman Supersonic Carbon Injector The Tallman Supersonic Carbon Injector (TSCi™) uses supersonic jets to create a coherent injection stream, delivering carbon to the bath at almost twice the speed of sound. As a turnkey carbon injection system, the assembly can be easily installed in any existing furnace using readily available plant air. Benefits:   Tallman Supersonic Lime Injector The Tallman Supersonic Lime Injector (TSLI™) uses supersonic jets to create a coherent injection stream, delivering HiCal lime and DoloLime to the bath at almost twice the speed of sound. As a turn-key lime injection system, the assembly can be easily installed in any existing furnace using readily available plant air. Benefits: EAF Lance Tips Tallman Technologies produces EAF Lance Tips using a proprietary and unique centrifugal casting grain refinement method. This method results in a monolithic Lance Tip with outstanding jet precision and wear characteristics, both of which are proven to be critical to excellent performance and increased Lance Tip life. Tallman Technologies’ EAF Lance Tips utilize our patented SWIRL COOL™ technology. Using computer-based computational fluid dynamic models, the internal geometry of the Lance Tip is designed to maximize cooling efficiency, extending Lance Tip life. Tallman Technologies has adapted supersonic jet technology from the aerospace industry specifically for the unique requirements of high temperature steelmaking processes. Together with our centrifugal casting technology and state-of-the-art 6-axis CNC machines, the complex geometry in Tallman Technologies’ EAF Lance Tips offer exceptional precision and efficiency, leading to improved steelmaking performance and yield.  Sill Panels The Tallman Sill Panel improves metallurgical performance by positioning your burners closer to the bath, for any burner system or furnace design. Utilizing a replaceable Front Burner Panel with adjustable burner mounting, the Tallman SILL Panel design provides complete customization with reduced maintenance costs.  Simply replace the Front Burner Panel while the rest of the assembly remains in the furnace. Separate cooling channels, with individual water connections, allows for flow rate customization.  Cast Copper Water Cooled Panels Experience has proven that copper panels along the sill result in increased furnace performance and reduction in maintenance costs. Tallman Technologies provides custom designed, water-cooled copper panels. With CFD simulation, water channels are custom designed to improve panel cooling. This improves panel life and reduces replacement cost. Cast copper water-cooled panels better absorb and distribute localized heat inputs when compared to conventional steel or copper pipe panel designs. As a result, cast copper water-cooled panels are not subject to weld or cracking failures; leading to significantly better performance and reduced costs. Tallman Technologies also designs and manufactures cast copper panels for the entire EAF.  Finger Cooler Panels A clever, one-piece design utilizes a water-cooled copper back plate together with solid, high purity copper cooling fins or ‘fingers’. During installation the back plate is connected to a cooling water circuit and the slots between the ‘fingers’ are packed with refractory. The result is effective cooling and much improved wear characteristics compared to refractory alone. The heat exchanger design virtually guaranties that the cooling water stays outside of the furnace, even as the cooling fingers and refractory find their equilibrium thickness. Tallman Finger Cooler Panels are custom designed for your EAF and can be installed in demanding and difficult areas of the EAF such as the sill, around the slag door, and the transition of the EBT. Finger Cooler Panels can also be used under sidewall burners/lances, or at any other hot spot located around the furnace. Services Tallman Technologies offers Repair and Maintenance services at our Foundry and Machine Shop located in Burlington, Ontario, Canada. We restore water-cooled copper panels, water-cooled probes and any other copper, steel or aluminum bronze piece in the EAF Shop.  We can also provide upgrades and improvements to reduce maintenance costs and improve product quality. Tallman can provide installation and commission services for all of our EAF products and technologies. Our product development team can develop custom refining solutions optimized for your process and provide the technical support needed to enhance your performance.

579,"Ironmaking Products Standard Blast Furnace Tuyeres To perform reliably, a Blast Furnace tuyere must not only have optimal design, but it must also be produced with very high purity copper to allow for maximum heat transfer. Tallman blast furnace parts are made to x-ray quality standards and by utilizing only the highest purity electrolytic copper, we have among the highest conductivity in the industry. Tallman tuyeres are designed and manufactured to meet and exceed the tough demands of today's modern Ironmaker. Tuyeres with High Velocity Spiral Cooling Modern blast furnace operations require tuyeres that can withstand increasingly severe operating conditions. While traditional flooded tuyere designs incorporate a single water inlet and outlet, in the event of nose wear or damage, the water must be shut off and the tuyere must be replaced immediately. Modern, dual flow tuyere designs allow the water to be shut off to the nose section only, allowing the tuyere to be replaced on the next scheduled outage, avoiding an unforeseen delay. Tallman takes the concept of a dual flow tuyere to the next level with intensive, computer optimized nose cooling designs, including radiused chamber and high velocity spiral designs. In addition, centrifugally cast tuyere noses are available using the same grain refinement technology used in Tallman's EAF and BOF lance tips, to increase wear resistance and improve overall life of the tuyere. Combining these technologies together with the latest in available hard facing methods, including calorizing, results in state of the art tuyere performance and life. CeraMet™Metal Refractory Tuyere Inserts Today's Ironmaker faces extreme challenges from high revert burdens and throttling requirements brought about by demanding and volatile market conditions. Tallman has responded to the challenge of running furnaces at reduced wind rate by developing a new tuyere insert that combines tremendous toughness and abrasion resistance under extreme high service temperature conditions. In addition, the alloy is centrifugally cast to maximize density and reduce porosity. The alloy has an oxidation rate of less than 0.5mm/year!. These inserts are engineered to provide long term service life at hot blast temperatures up to 2200°F (1200°c). Calorized Tuyeres Blast Furnace tuyeres must perform reliably in the harsh environment they are placed. Standard tuyeres fail prematurely due to iron drips that dissolve the copper and create ""Bullet Hole"" defects. Calorizing is a pack diffusion process where the copper tuyere is placed in a sealed retort containing aluminum powder. The casting is heated and aluminum is diffused into the surface, creating a copper aluminide inner layer and an aluminum oxide outer layer. Calorizing creates a protective layer on the copper tuyere that preventing liquid iron drips from penetrating the surface. The calorizing process is performed at the final stage of production after the tuyere is finished machined and hardfacing alloys are applied. Calorizing eliminates the need to use refractory materials on the top surface of the tuyere. Services Content Calorizing Calorizing is a pack diffusion process where the copper casting is placed in a sealed retort containing aluminum powder. The casting is heated and aluminum is diffused into the surface, creating a copper aluminide inner layer and an aluminum oxide outer layer. The Coating is diffused into the copper thereby creating a perfect bond with the copper substrate. The thickness of the coating is approximately 1 mm and consists of three layers:   Tallman Technologies Inc.2220 Industrial StreetBurlington, Ontario L7P 1A1Canada P: 905.335.3491F: 905.335.5896E: © 2023 Tallman Technologies Inc.All Rights ReservedPrivacy Policy|Sitemap Virtual Image ",3793,572

595,"Main Navigation The Manufacturing Process Investment Casting The investment casting process involves making a wax duplicate of the casting by injecting wax into an aluminum mold. Several copies of the wax part are then assembled onto a sprue to create a “tree”. The wax tree is then dipped into a ceramic slurry several times to create an outer shell coating. Next, the shell is placed in an oven to melt and drain out the wax, thus creating cavities ready to receive molten metal. The metal is poured into the shells creating the castings. Once the metal has cooled, the shell is knocked off leaving a “tree” consisting of the castings, ingates and sprue. In the finishing department, the castings are cut off the tree, and finished by grinding or sanding any remnants of the ingates. Advantages Design Considerations Sand Molding The No-Bake Sand casting process involves creating a mold using sand and resin. Sand is packed around a pattern that contains the imprint of the casting to create a cope (top half of sand mold) and drag (bottom half of sand mold). Molten metal is poured into the sand mold, through the runner and gating system and allowed to cool and solidify.  The sand is broken away from the metal and recycled to create more molds.  The metal casting is finished by cutting and grinding any excess metal.  Further processing may include heat treating, machining or painting.

For a complete breakdown of ourMetal Grades, Chemical Composition, Hardness and Strength, please view this link. 3D Printing 3D printing may be a low-cost option if looking for small quantities of parts such as 1-10 pieces.  It works like this: 1. A solid model file is used to 3D Print the actual part in plastic or wax and the dimensions are scaled up slightly to account for metal shrinkage. 2. The 3D plastic part is used as a pattern to make the metal casting.  The 3D printed pattern can be used in both processes (sand and investment casting), the same way regular patterns are used. 3. By using 3D printing the customer will avoid the cost of making a permanent mold or pattern that can typically cost between$4000 – $5000, so it may be more economical for small quantities.

For decades, Acra Cast has been providing quick turnaround deliveries for prototype and low volume castings using 3D printed patterns in lieu of wax patterns and traditional wax injection tooling.Using customer provided CAD data, patterns can be printed in just a few days and castings poured in under a week. Secondary operations such as heat treatment and machining will add to delivery times.Because the 3D pattern replaces only the wax pattern, we’re still pouring into a ceramic mold so virtually any alloy we cast in production can be used to produce protoype castings.The excellent surface finishes and tolerances our customers have come to expect from Acra Cast production castings can be duplicated using rapid protoype technology.In summary, using Acra Cast as your source for rapid prototype castings offers the following advantages: Extremely quick deliveriesUses industry standard CAD formatsNo permanent tooling is requiredThe same great alloy selection as used in production castingsValidate designs with one or more generations of protoypes before going into full scale productionCompress timelines from concept to marketPerfect for a ‘one off’ repair part or specialized applications  Acra Cast1837 First StreetBay City, MI 48708989.893.3961sales@acracast.com Home|About Us|Applications|Services|Contact|IndustriesCase Studies|FAQs|News|Awards|ResourcesCareers|Alloys|Tradeshows|Rapid Prototyping|Request a Quote Investment casting foundry in Bay City, MichiganPrivacy Policy - Terms and ConditionsCopyright Â©Acra Cast.

The face mask was converted from a welded wire design. Casting allowed the designer greater flexibility and more creativity than conventional cut wire and welded methods.The cast face mask showed less permanent deformation than welded wire equivalents in drop tests. In the drop tests, the cast masks also transmitted between 25 and 35% less energy to the wearer, reducing the risk of concussion.  Acra Cast Casting Featured in Metal Casting Design & PurchasingSilicon Bronze Component Metal Casting Design & Purchasing magazine recently featured our casting in its May/June 2015 issue. One of the great things about this was the fact that the original part was made in Europe and we brought it to America by making it at a lower cost and with a faster delivery.

623,"Quality Assurance and Systematic Control – OEE System One of the foundations of any successful manufacturing business is a sound system to assure a quality product. In order to satisfy the needs of customers in today’s manufacturing environment, you must have a strong understanding of quality system principles and techniques. The use of quality assurance tools to run your business on a day to day basis must become culturally ingrained within a company. Every member of the team must consistently focus on following the quality system to assure that the customer’s needs and expectations are achieved. We, as a management team, were directly responsible for the Quality System that was first in the nation, among die casting companies, to be registered as compliant to the ISO 9001-2015 Quality System Standard. However, we recognize that the certification pales in comparison to the benefits that full utilization of these systems offer to a company. We have the knowledge and experience to develop and implement quality systems in the manufacturing environment, that will fully capitalize on these benefits. The successful implementation of any complete quality system requires input and involvement by various disciplines within a management team, this is because of the fact that in today business, a quality system includes everything from reviewing the customer contract to preventive maintenance of your machinery. The twenty clauses of the ISO standard must be represented and addressed. The combined experience of our management team covers all of the disciplines necessary to build and maintain a compliant system in all areas. Designed byElegant Themes| Powered byWordPress ",1688,260
623,"Die Cast Process Control Success in the die casting industry relies on the ability to successfully manage the die casting process. In order to fully manage this process you must be conscious of the interactions of numerous variables and gain a complete understanding of the thermal transfer cycles that take place within the relatively short cycle of a die casting machine. In this business, there is no substitute for experience, experience is the only teacher that will enable a person to fully understand what it takes to produce a quality die casting. AtAppalachian Cast Products,we are diecasters with decades of experience. While our skills cover many disciplines, we recognize and understand that the bottom line in this business depends primarily on our ability to provide our customers with top quality casting, on time, and at a price that is competitive in this industry. We also realize that competitive pricing is not a result of scrimping on equipment or technology, but is accomplished by utilizing the latest in technologies to increase efficiencies and simply out perform the competition. Toward this end we will utilize the latest in die casting equipment, set up in a efficient “cell” arrangement to assure that every activity is optimized and that the efficiency of our equipment and personnel is at the highest level in the industry. As with all process, success in die casting relies on the development of a process which is capable of producing a quality product, studying and truly understanding that process, and continuously monitoring that process to assure that the parameters established are maintained and consistent. Additionally, such a process must be managed in an atmosphere of continuous improvement and team work. A strong team must be built to assure that all personnel remain focused on the task of providing our customers with the highest level of products and services. The technological advances in the die casting industry over the last several years have allow diecasters to fully understand our process and continuously strive for improvements in quality and efficiency. The elements of the die cast cell have change over the years to include robotics for molten metal delivery, application of die release agents, and extraction of castings from the mold. In addition to these refinements we are also dedicated  to the use of process monitoring and control equipment to assure that our processes are consistently maintained. However, as automated as this business continues to become, the primary factor in the success of a die casting business remains the people who develop, control, and manage the process.

623,"Training In order for any company to succeed the entire organization must be empowered to do their part on a daily basis. In order for all employee to consistently perform to the level expected by our customers, we must provide each person with the tools they need to fully understand and excel in their position.Providing employees with these necessary tools means training. In order for a group of people, with different backgrounds and interests, to become a fully functioning team, the entire team must develop a common understanding of their functions and the products and services that they are providing to our customers. AtAppalachian Cast Products, we believe that in order to succeed our employees must be truly a part of the team. They are the most important asset that we have and without their input and cooperation we cannot fully achieve our goals. Our management team has extensive experience in the development and execution of training programs specific to our business.

Determination depends on your requirements for size, run quantity, and the dimensional accuracy and surface finish required.The following processes are available for each kind of metal. ·Permanent Mold:Permanent mold is a metal casting process that employs a reusable - or permanent mold, usually made from metal. The most common process uses gravity to fill the mold. ·Green Metal Sand Casting: These castings are made using sand molds formed from using a mix of sand, clay, flour, and water.  The sand is moist and reusable after being separated from the casting. This process is used for small to medium size parts. ·No-Bake Metal Sand Casting: No-bake molds are expendable sand molds formed from using a mix of sand, resins and catalysts that harden the mold.  This type of molding also produces a better surface finish than green sand molds. The sand is not reusable and must be  disposed of properly. This process is used for medium to larger size parts. ·Precision Shell Sand- expendable mold casting process that uses a resin covered sand that is blown onto to preheated iron patterns. The sand is blown onto the pattern and bakes the sand on to form the mold. This process has better dimensional accuracy, a higher productivity rate, and lower labor requirements. The sand is not reusable and must be disposed of properly. It is used for small to medium parts that require higher precision tolerances and finishes. ·Harrison Flaskless Matchplate Mold Machine: Automatic molding machine that makes sand castings using green sand.

670,"Innocast Execuline Team Brent Hartwig President My name is Brent Hartwig and I am President of Innocast Corporation. Hard work ethics learned from a farming background aided in a successful 20+ year career of robotics and industrial automation until purchasing Innocast ownership from a family friend in 2015. The experiences learned from the engineering world definitely come in handy when creating unique awards programs. I am a huge proponent of employee personal growth and value teamwork as each employee has a talent in areas that some of us are weak in. With this mindset, it will enable Innocast to experience continued growth and become a visible and sought after custom award manufacturer once again. My wife Darci and I are blessed with three wonderful sons who all love to spend their time in extreme sports. Being an active Ski Patrol volunteer certainly comes in handy when the boys have a few cuts and scrapes. An interesting fact that people may not know about me is that I have had to opportunity to spend five years traveling the world as a robotic specialist. Those experiences definitely help with understanding different cultures and allow one to appreciate what you have in your life. Jackie Riehle Office Manager I have many hats in my position here at Innocast! My main focus is on my communication with our customers. I offer support in many aspects such as quoting, processing orders and artwork, providing updates on orders, and meeting all their basic needs. And as I mentioned I have many hats . . . In the seven years I have been with Innocast, my greatest accomplishment is the relationship I have formed with our repeat customers and getting to know new customers. Our customers keep me going each day and I enjoy assisting them in recognizing individuals for a job well done! I started with Innocast in 2013 having a strong background in customer service. With that, coming to Innocast seemed like a good fit. I have learned many different trades after coming here. In the next 10 years, I hope to be doing some traveling so that I am able to meet the customer I email and speak to over the phone. The vision that Brent and Darci have for Innocast is vast and I am excited to see us grow and to be a part of the growth! Along with working full time, I am a busy mom to 5 kids. If meeting me for the first time you would think “wow, she’s got a lot on her plate” – I do! I love being busy and occupy my time away from work supporting my kids and husband. They keep me busy with school, sports, church, lots of volunteer work/support for my husband with our local Fire Department. Darci Hartwig Customer Care Specialist My name is Darci Hartwig and I started with Innocast in 2018. My husband Brent and I decided that the timing was right for me to join him at Innocast and move forward with our goals to grow and expand the business. After working in the dental field for 20 years, 15 of them being a dental hygienist, I bring a lot of experience with communicating with people. One of my favorite things about this industry is getting to know new people. Currently, I keep busy here with coming up with new ideas to expand our product line, communicating with clients to make sure their needs are being met, ordering supplies, consistently coming up with new ways to improve our shipping department, and love planning our next lunch ‘pot luck’. Both Brent and I feel it is very important to offer the best customer service available and will go above and beyond to make sure our clients are taken care of! With 3 very busy boys at home it can sometimes be hard to find the balance with work and making sure I am able to be there for them, but we have a pretty good system that takes a lot of teamwork between Brent and I. They definitely keep us on our toes, but I wouldn’t want it any other way! In my ‘free time’, I enjoy refurbishing furniture and selling at a local store which also keeps me pretty busy. I look forward to Innocast growing and the vision that Brent and I have set…we are committed to providing service that we are proud to be known for. The accomplishment of being part of a team that creates such beautiful, quality awards is an honor that I am very proud of! ",4215,763

Fidelity is our âgo-toâ firm when we have more complex designs and/or when we need innovative problem solving. When failure is not an option, I always steer my team to Fidelity. Working with Jeff and the group at Fidelity has been a very positive experience. He and his team helped us to design and build a novel device called the Dextrometer for our research lab. We have used this device to precisely measure finger force and movements in individuals after they have a stroke. Fidelity has been quite supportive over the course of our time working together and I would strongly recommend them to others. âI found Fidelity through a Google search back in 2014. I met up with Corey and went for a shop tour. The shop was very clean, well organized and the high quality work that they do was very evident. I explained the complexities of my project and Corey had confidence that they could build an exceptional tool. They banged out the tooling within the quoted lead time and we were floored with the quality. There was absolutely no short cuts taken. The first push of the tool produced a production viable part - that's rare.

The company offers the full range of technical skills necessary to ensure castings are managed effectively from design through utilization.  Hycast has manufactured engineered castings for the full spectrum of castings.  Hycast has completed prestige architectural projects across the world, includingDubai International Airport Terminal3's distinctive tear drop windows andHong Kong'sOne Island Eastfoyer support structure, including 220 kg distinctive and unique vierendeel truss elements. A Successful Formula Hycast has the technology, Intellectual Property and experience to design products to meet high end specifications. For example, on an project such as theDubai Terminal 3, Hycast completed the following design steps to ensure the product met the the load and design constrains; 3D Computer Modelling:The first step of the design process is to develop a 3D computer model of the proposed casting and its components. Finite Element Analysis (FEA):The FEA is a linear static finite element analysis of the casting to demonstrate the maximum developed stress when design loads are applied. Casting Simulation:Technology is used to simulate and visualise the entire casting process. This allows the team to establish the most effective and timely process minimising defects and maximising throughput. Rapid Prototyping:Rapid Prototyping technology combines computer modelling with automated wax printing to produce a ""near perfect"" single casting. This technology is important as it allows the client to confirm shape, form and finish prior to the commencement of tooling. World Class Manufacturing & Quality     Hycast Metals is in a constant frame of mind of ""continual improvement"" and has obtained the relevant certifications/accreditations to achieve that goal.  Hycast Metals certified/accredited to: ISO 9001 Quality Management Systems ISO/IEC 17025 NATA Accredited Laboratory AS/NZS ISO 45001 Safety Management Systems ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Department of Defence Recognised Supplier      Manufacture of Unique Facade Brick Central Police Station (CPS) Hong Kong Hycast Metals has successfully engaged with high profile architects, engineers, contractors and projects in Hong Kong since 1998. Consequently, Hycast was invited to submit a proposal for the manufacture and supply of 8,200 aluminium bricks to be incorporated in the Central Police Station restoration project, Hong Kong. Hycast was asked to make this submission, as the architect was not satisfied with current offerings from 70 worldwide suppliers. Hycast Metals as a company  has a strong structural engineering and metallurgical base, as a foundation. Hycast offered a low pressure die cast casting, incorporating the granite texture with a unique finish for aluminium. This is what the architect was seeking. Hycast won the contract on quality. Alloys Alloys can be chosen from a range of steels and stainless steels as well as nickel alloys, cobalt alloys, cast iron, brass, bronze, aluminium and other alloys to suit most purposes. Your own special alloys may be also made up for specific applications and certified in our NATA accredited metals analysis laboratory. The most commonly cast alloy groups are listed below; 200 Series Stainless Steels - Ferritic 300 Series Stainless Steels - Austenitic 400 Series Stainless Steels - Martensitic Precipitation Hardening Stainless Steels Duplex Stainless Steels Heat Resistant Stainless Steels Abrasion Resistant Steels Nickel Alloys Carbon and Low Alloy Steels Tool Steels Cast Irons Copper Alloys Cobalt Alloys Aluminium Alloys Alloy Brochure: Tables listing the most popular alloys and their mechanical properties. Process Wax Injection:Wax replicas of the desired castings are produced by injecting tooling with wax. These replicas are called wax patterns. Assembly:The wax patterns are attached to a central wax runner bar, to form an investment tree. Shell Building:The shell is built by immersing the tree in a liquid ceramic slurry and then coating in a refractory product. Up to 5 layers may be applied in this manner. This stage is the creation of the “Investment mould”. De-Wax:Once the ceramic shell is dry, the wax is melted out, using an autoclave creating a negative impression of the assembly within the shell. Casting:The investment mould trees are fired in an oven and pulled out while hot. The shell is then filled with molten metal by gravity pouring. After the mould has been filled, the molten metal is allowed to cool and solidify into the shape of the final casting. Cooling time depends on the thickness of the part, thickness of the mould, and the material used. Knock Off:When the metal has cooled and solidified, the ceramic shell is broken off. Cut Off:The parts are then cut away from the central runner bar using a high speed cut-off saw or band saw. Finishing:Finishing operations such as grinding or sandblasting are used to smooth the part at the gates. Heat treatment may be specified to add further treatment to the final part. Inspection:All parts are inspected for quality and shipped to the customer. Precision Investment Castings Hycast Metals Copyright © 2015 Hycast Metals ",5317,806

703,"The Eagle Bronze Story I got my first real exposure to the art industry after I had married my beautiful wife Beverly.  Her father Bud Boller was and is a known respected artist in Wyoming, known mostly for his bronze sculpture, but is amazing with a pencil as well.  Before we begin the journey down the road to Eagle Bronze, let me first take you to the beginning, because without this beginning, I would not be in the art business after all!I know this is many, many years back, but the story really starts before I even left high school for college.  Through high school, I had always had my eyes on a younger girl that had lived just done the street from my parentâs home in Lander.  A very cute little gal that I used to adore from a distance.  Not in the âstalkerâ way, we hadnât really heard of this term in those days.  Truth be told, it seems she stalked me, in the form of binoculars from her house as I worked on chores in the yard!""Lander is known nationally as âthe City of Bronzeâ â Main St. features more bronze statues percapita than any other town its size in the country, thanks to the presence of Eagle Bronze Foundry and Gallery.""Wyoming and Lander Tourism/Development DepartmentMy âstalkerâ wife, moreover my high school sweetheart, and I did end up getting married and headed off to college at the University of Wyoming.  I studied Mechanical Engineering and my wife studied art.  We braved the cold winters of Laramie, and after I graduated, we moved to the Loveland area so I could work as an engineer for Eastman Kodak.On a side note about my stint with Eastman Kodak.  They of course hired me right out of college.  Before we officially moved to Colorado to take on my role with Eastman Kodak, we were sent to Rochester, New York for training.  Being from Wyoming, we were somewhat naÃ¯ve and oblivious to some goings on around us.  We apparently were living on the âwrong sideâ of the tracks the whole time we were there.  We found out later when we returned to Colorado, that we were living in very close proximity to a famous mob hang out, the âChatter Boxâ.  Not believing we were in any danger and with the Lord on our side, I even played basketball with some of the neighborhood guys.  Being a whitey with a indefensible hook, I earned the nickname âCool Breezeâ.Now back to the story.  After some time in Colorado, we moved to Colville, Washington so that I could work with my dad on his ranch and also took a full time engineering job at Alcoa.  Needless to say, I was very busy keeping our ranch going, working as a full time engineer, and now trying to help raise a family of four daughters.  Burning the candle at both ends, the Lord started to prompt my spirit, some times flat out hit me, and started to move me in a different direction.  After my father passed away at an early age from cancer, it was only a matter of time, before I felt a different calling to my life.To make long story short (too late), we decided to move back to our hometown of Lander, Wyoming so that we could start a smallsculpture foundryto produce Beverly's father's bronzes and I to pastor a Vineyard Church.  I guess the Lord had slightly other plans.  We have taken our little foundry operation to one of the largest in the world.  Having redesigned the way we build and engineer monuments, we have been told that we are the largest producer of monuments in the world, and can do them quicker than most, keeping the integrity that the artist had originally produced.Beverly also started sculpting along the way and is a very gifted and talented artist.  Her ability to create softness and life in everything she sculpts is truly a gift from the Lord.  Her work has kept our vision of ministry going.  I may not be the pastor I thought I was called to be, but I have been able to see the impact Bevâs art has had and been able to use this as a tool to minister to people along the way.  God was calling me to ministry, just not how I had seen it!Along the way, we added some additional help to our facility.  In 1999, my oldest daughter Heather and her husband Matt decided to join our fight and help run our business.  Heather studied accounting in college and is now our Controller.  Matt, having studied Structural and Mechanical Engineering in college, is now our Vice President.  With the addition of these two, we now have the ability to expand our operations and move in directions we never would have if they were not present.We have rebranded Eagle Bronze to move in a direction that has made us more than just a fine art foundry.  We have become an art marketing group that can take conception to completion, help our artists find and place projects, and much more.  We have become a facility that can do more than just recreate and manufacture art.  Above all, it has always been  about the relationships we have made over the years.  It is about our everlasting friendships we have built and hope to continue to build.  We are more than just a business; we are your friends, your partners.  We look forward to forging a future together with you!

705,"EPS INDUSTRIES Lost Wax Process Investment Casting EPS Industries - Your Experts in Investment CastingEPS has been perfecting and continuously improving the art of investment casting since 2000. Our over 20 years of service manufacturing parts for the medical, transportation, military, steam component, pump and valve industries give us the base of expertise to provide you with the quality parts you need. Why Lost Wax Process Casting?Lost wax process investment casting is the closest you can get to a net shape manufacturing process. Using the lost wax method, EPS investment castings produce parts so close in tolerance that, in many cases, no further machining or finishing is necessary. Once the initial tooling is perfected, every subsequent casting is an identical copy of the original. You save time and money. Your customer gets a better product. Here’s how: Gain Design & Materials FlexibilityInvestment casting affords more freedom of design and access to a wider range of alloys than shell or sand castings offer. EPS routinely casts more than 120 ferrous and nonferrous metals. Eliminate Tooling Set-upBy offering near-net-shape configuration, fixturing costs are substantially reduced or eliminated altogether. Reduce Production CostsPrecise dimensional tolerance of the lost wax process often eliminates machining on some surfaces, thus reducing costly finishing operations. With EPS as your investment castings source, the only capital equipment investment required to produce the parts is the tool. Cut Assembly OperationsLost Wax process investment castings allow the replacement of multi-component parts with a single part. Several parts can be made as one casting, reducing handling, assembly and inspection costs. Reproduce Fine DetailsThe ability to reproduce fine details using the lost wax process allows EPS to produce a vast array of products from very close tolerance pressure fittings and valves to intricate trophies, medals and figurines.

705,"The EPS Lost Wax Investment Casting Process Lost wax investment casting is a craft that has been practiced for thousands of years. At EPS, we have incorporated many innovations, which allows us to produce finely detailed cast parts quickly and accurately using a large variety of alloys. The following is a simplified explanation of our casting process from start to finish.  The Pattern A wax pattern is created for each casting in the exact geometry of the part to be completed. This pattern is generally made by injecting wax or plastic into a metal form or die. The die is an aluminum tool that is more or less sophisticated, depending on the application or requirements. Each form or die may be as simple in design as the head of a golf club or as complex as a minute valve system for a rocket.  The Cluster Multiple wax  patterns are attached together forming a cluster or ""tree"" of the same pattern, allowing a large number of parts to be cast at the same time.  The Mold Each cluster is dipped in a ceramic slurry, which is drained and coated with fine ceramic sand, then dried.  Final Mold The dipping process is repeated again and again using progressively coarser grades of material until a thick, self-supporting shell has been formed.  Dewaxing Once the shell is dry, it is heated to cause the wax to run out. The wax is collected for reuse.  Pre-Heating The clusters are pre-heated in a furnace to prepare for casting.  Pouring The specified molten metal alloy is poured into the cluster.  The Resulting Castings After the poured cluster has cooled, the ceramic mold material is removed from the castings by mechanical vibration and chemical cleaning, leaving the tree of castings.  Finished Product Each part is cut away from the cluster and smoothed. Some parts are ready to ship at this point, while others may go through  final machining or other operations.

716,"About Us Trusted for over 80 years On 15 April 1937, two partners – Alexander Dingwall and William Price – decided to start a steel foundry that would supply South Africa’s growing mining industry. At the time, Alexander’s daughter, Mary, was engaged to William’s son, Les Price. To mark the joining of the two families and the launch of a family business, the partners combined the names ‘Price’ and ‘Mary’ to form the name PRIMA Iron and Steel Foundry and Engineering Works (Pty) Ltd. They may not have known it at the time but, on that day, the founding partners – both in their sixties and planning for retirement – established what would become one of South Africa’s oldest and most established family-owned foundries. 50 to 1,000 in 80 years Production started in 1938, on a five-acre piece of land in Benoni, South Africa. With just one two-ton electric arc furnace, PRIMA cast an average of 50 tons per month of iron and steel castings for replacement wear parts. A lot changed in the next eight decades. Today, PRIMA occupies over 16 acres of land and has a monthly casting capacity of over 1,000 tons, with exports into all of the major mining regions. We provide a full spectrum of design, manufacturing, and after-sales services, with a focus on the global supply of grinding mill liners and crusher wear parts. But one thing hasn’t changed.

733,"Request a Quote - Click to view ISO Certificate Home Company Mission Services Tooling Contacts History S.U.S. Die Casting was formed in 1946. S.U.S. is reportedly the oldest non-captive die casting company in Indiana. The founder, Mr. Salvador U. Siena, a forerunner in the development of the die casting process was quite successful in introducing the die cast process to many industries. The 1950s brought about Mr. Siena's death, however, the ownership was retained by the family and the business continued to grow through the 1960s & 70s.  The 1980s were a continual struggle to maintain market positions previously established. The required emphasis of change and realignment to meet the needs of a changing market-place were not in place.  In July, 1992 S.U.S. Die Casting was acquired from the Siena family by George Todd. Mr. Todd established the newly formed company as S.U.S. Cast Products. Mr. Todd brought to the new company decades of casting experience and best practices gained in the automotive industry. A clear vision and implementation of management systems and focusing on the customers needs have been instrumental in the successes S.U.S. has consistently realized for the past 20 years.  Jeff Todd joined his father in the business in 1993. Capitalizing upon an engineering background and mentoring of his industry veteran father, Jeff learned every facet of the die casting business cumulating with the succession of his father in 2008 as company president and shareholder.  In 2011, Jeff decided to bring in a partner to complement the leadership team and position S.U.S. for the next 20 years of growth and success. JR Merlau joined S.U.S. in September as company president. JR brings to S.U.S. 20 years of experience in administration, sales & marketing, and business development.  S.U.S. is a financially sound privately held company owned in whole by JR Merlau and Jeff Todd committed to providing service and quality excellence to our valued customers and a positive and rewarding work life to our employees. Location S.U.S. operates a 65,000+ square foot facility in Logansport, Indiana.  Logansport is a domestic low cost manufacturing region centrally located slightly north of Indianapolis with convenient access to all shipping routes and major markets.

756,"Fonte grise Fonte grise : un matériau très populaire La fonte grise est le type de fonte le plus répandu sur le marché en raison de ses nombreuses caractéristiques avantageuses. Ces alliages de fonte sont classés selon leur résistance maximale. C’est donc dire qu’une fonte grise classe 30 devra résister un minimum de 30 000 psi avant la rupture. Par contre, les fontes grises n’ont pas un très bon pourcentage d’allongement avant la rupture. Les fontes grises peuvent aussi être alliées pour augmenter la résistance mécanique et la résistance à la corrosion. Dans le cas du Ni-Hard, c’est un ajout de nickel et de chrome qui lui permet d’augmenter la résistance à l’abrasion. Nous produisons différents alliages de fonte grise, selon la demande des clients : Fonte résistante à l’abrasion : Comme plus de 90 % de nos pièces doivent être usinées, il est primordial d’avoir une bonne qualité de fonte. De plus, nous utilisons des filtres de céramique lors de la coule pour enrayer le maximum d’impuretés. Grâce à notre laboratoire, d’autres alliages de fonte grise plus personnalisés peuvent être élaborés selon les demandes du client. Avant chaque coulée, un échantillon est pris et analysé afin de nous assurer que le métal respecte la bonne analyse chimique.

756,"Gray cast iron Gray Cast Iron: A Highly Popular Material Due to its many attractive features, gray cast iron is the most commonly found casting on the market. These casting alloys are classified according to their maximum resistance. This means that class 30 gray cast iron needs to obtain at least 30,000 psi of tensile strength before the breaking point. However, gray cast irons do not boast a high percentage elongation prior to breaking. To increase mechanical and corrosion endurance, alloys of gray cast iron can be made. As for Ni-Hard cast iron castings, the addition of nickel increases resistance to abrasion. We produce different types of gray cast iron castings based on our clients’ needs: Abrasion-resistant casting: As over 90% of our parts need to be machined, a high grade of cast iron is needed. Moreover, we use ceramic filters during the moulding process to remove as much foreign matter as we can. In our laboratory, we make custom gray cast iron castings tailored to our clients’ requirements. Before pouring castings, we carry out a chemical analysis to make sure the molten metal meets the right chemical analysis and the right standards. Upon your request, we can provide a highly-detailed lab report containing the manufactured alloy’s chemical analysis, tensile test, and metallography. Contact us for more detailed information.

781,"Brass Metal Stampings, Bronze Metal Stampings, Nickel Silver Metal Stampings Brass Metal Stampings There are more than 400 copper alloys, each with a unique combination of properties, to suit many applications, manufacturing processes and environments.Brass is the generic term for a range of copper-zinc alloys with differing combinations of properties, including strength, machinability, ductility, wear-resistance, hardness, color, hygienic, electrical and thermal conductivity, and corrosion-resistance. Common brass alloys used at New England Precision include UNS Brass is often used in the key and lock hardware industry for its machinability.  It is also highly used in the fire protection industry for its excellent thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance.  Copper is alloyed mostly with zinc.  The lower UNS numbers have higher copper content which improves corrosion resistance, thermal conductivity and solder ability.  Generally speaking; higher zinc content improves strength.  C35000 and C35300 contain lead for machinability. Reference ASTM B152/B 152M specification for details: (Nominal percentages, based on weight)  Nickel Silver Metal Stampings These silver colored copper-nickel-zinc alloys containing 10-20% nickel can be regarded as special brasses. In most respects they show similar corrosion characteristics to the brasses, but the higher nickel versions have superior tarnish resistance and resistance to stress corrosion cracking. Common nickel silver alloys used at New England Precision include UNS Our nickel silver alloy parts are used mostly in our key and lock hardware for strength, corrosion resistance and machinability. Examples from ASTM B152/B 152M specification: (Nominal percentages based on weight) New England Precision, Inc. has a leading advantage over other tool and stamping companies by purchasing 5-7 million pounds of copper contained alloys every year.

789,"Alloy Cast Products Inc. Precision Investment Casting, Cutting Tools, Wear & Corrosion Resistant Parts. EXTRUSION DIES INSTRUCTIONS ON THE USE OF REXALLOY®™ 33 EXTRUSION DIE INSERTS Step 1 REXALLOY®™ die inserts are usually furnished ground on O.D. and two faces. The die holder can be made from Halcomb 118 bar stock or forgings, and should be about 50% thicker than the insert. The holder should be drilled with the hole slightly larger than the extruded bar size, and then counterbored to a depth slightly greater than the thickness of the insert, and to a diameter .008”/.010” less than the diameter of the insert. Larger inserts, greater than 2.000″ O.D. I, may require .010″/.015″ shrinkage. The die holder should be hardened to about 40 -HRC. REXALLOY®™ is a proprietary trademark of Alloy Cast Products, Inc. (73779483) U.S.A Step 2 After the insert is finished and polished the I.D., shrinking into the holder is then accomplished by heating the holder to about 400/500 degrees Fahrenheit, and then preferably cooling the insert in dry ice. A pin gauge a few thousandths longer than the diameter of the insert, when cold, can be used to check the counterbore of the heated die for size before dropping the insert into the die holder. It is important that the REXALLOY®™ insert be under compression so that there will be a tendency to close up any heat checks which usually form on the inside surfaces in the first or second extrusion pass. REXALLOY®™ is a proprietary trademark of Alloy Cast Products, Inc. (73779483) U.S.A Step 3 The dies should be preheated slowly to a temperature of at least 700-800 degrees Fahrenheit before the first extrusion. It is important that wide temperature fluctuations be avoided, otherwise heat checking will be extensive, and flake-out may occur. Thus cooling between pushes is unnecessary, and after the last push, the dies should be slowly cooled in air to room temperature. DO NOT WATER JACKET COOL. Step 4 REXALLOY®™ dies should be swabbed with a graphite-base lubricant before each extrusion. REXALLOY®™ is a proprietary trademark of Alloy Cast Products, Inc. (73779483) U.S.A Step 5 REXALLOY®™ dies are overhauled when necessary by belt-polishing with a fine grit abrasive belt, or die grinder with a fine stone. REXALLOY®™ dies hold their size exceptionally well because of their high hardness at elevated temperatures, (see details on DATA SHEET), and the fact that REXALLOY®™ is unaffected by any heat treatment, and cannot be tempered or annealed. REXALLOY®™ is a proprietary trademark of Alloy Cast Products, Inc.

789,"Alloy Cast Products Inc. Precision Investment Casting, Cutting Tools, Wear & Corrosion Resistant Parts. REXALLOY®™ GRADE 33 Wear, Corrosion Resistant Parts & Cutting Tools REXALLOY®™ is a proprietary trademark of Alloy Cast Products, Inc. (73779483) U.S.A Abrasion and Wear Resistance:Conventional indentation hardness tests or Rockwell tests do not generally determine the relative wear resistance of REXALLOY®™ as compared with other materials such as tool steels. High carbon-high chrome tool steels commonly used for maximum resistance to abrasion or wear can be heat treated to about 64 Rockwell C (885 VPN). REXALLOY®™ , for non-cutting applications, has a hardness of about 54 Rockwell C (654 VPN). However, the hardness of the individual micro-constituents gives an entirely different picture: The primary carbides in REXALLOY®™ are much harder than the large carbides in high carbon-high chrome tool steel, 1810 VPN as compared to 1390 VPN, although the matrix in REXALLOY®™ is softer, 488 VPN as compared to 840 VPN. Thus, the conventional Rockwell tests provide an average hardness which mask the effect of hard and soft constituents in a CAST heterogeneous alloy of this type. It is the large surface area of massive primary high-hardness carbides which produces the wear resistant quality of REXALLOY®™ . TABER Wear Test ResultsThe samples were tested to 10,000 cycles with a 1000 gram load – 500 grams on each wheel. The abrading wheel was H-1O calibrade, a wheel designed for alloys resistant to abrasion.After 10,000 cycles, results as follows: Additional Features Resistance to Scaling:REXALLOY®™ has considerable resistance to oxidation and scaling. During heating no visible oxide film is formed until the temperature exceeds 9001Ú4 F. Scaling tests indicate that REXALLOY®™ has a scale resistance comparable to Rezistal 310 at temperatures up to 20001Ú4 F. Forming and Heat Treatment:REXALLOY®™ 33 cannot be formed in any way by hot or cold working and does not respond to heat treatment. Its high hardness is obtained in the AS-CAST condition, and is not appreciably affected by heating at temperatures up to 20001Ú4 F. However, heating REXALLOY®™ cutting tools at temperatures above 1600 F causes a gradual reduction in their cutting life over time. Grinding:REXALLOY®™ is generally finished by grinding. Any soft wheel, not coarser than 46 or finer than 60 in Grade “X” or “J”, is suitable for machine-grinding REXALLOY®™ . Light feeds should be taken to avoid heat checking. REXALLOY®™ tools should not be quenched during grinding. REQUEST A QUOTE Machining:The lower-hardness type of REXALLOY®™ for non-cutting applications can be machined with tungsten carbide tools. All types of REXALLOY®™ castings are being successfully turned with several grades of carbide tools at a surface speed of 25-40 feet/minute, a feed of .003″/revolution and a cutting depth of .010/.020 inches without coolant. REXALLOY®™ can be drilled or reamed with masonry-type carbide drills using slow speeds fine feeds and a coolant. Brazing:REXALLOY®™ is most satisfactorily joined to steel or other REXALLOY®™ parts by brazing. It is never recommended to attempt to weld REXALLOY®™ . Silver solder and a paste flux are recommended for brazing. The essentials of the process consist of grinding and cleaning the face, applying the flux, inserting the brazing strip between the faces binding the parts together with Nichrome wire, heating carefully to 13501Ú4F to 14501Ú4 F and applying pressure as the brazed solidifies on cooling. (Handy and Harman’s Handy Flux and Easy Flo #3 (carbide type) are recommended) Typical Applications Hardness: Tools for Cutting Applications 55 to 63 Rockwell CParts for Non-Cutting Applications 50 to 57 Rockwell C Mechanical Properties: Tensile Strength Elevated Temperature Hardness: REXALLOY ®™ has a high degree of red hardness. The comparison between REXALLOY ®™ and hardened Rex AA, 18-4-1, high speed steel is shown in the following tabulations: Hardness at temperature — BHN 18-4-1 High SpeedTemperature 1Ú4FRex AAREXALLOY®™12005104701400220450160015542518001353952000110340 Comments:Converted to BHN from Impact Brinell at temperature. On cooling to room temperature, REXALLOY ®™ attains its original hardness. Physical Properties: General Corrosion Resistance: The next important property of REXALLOY®™ is its superior resistance to corrosion. In laboratory tests, standard REXALLOY®™ 33 was found to be resistant to the following: On the other hand, REXALLOY®™ is not satisfactorily resistant to 2% Hydrochloric Acid at 15001Ú4 F, nor to boiling 65% Nitric Acid. Thus REXALLOY®™ successfully resists corrosion by moist atmosphere salt spray, the milder acids and certain of the stronger acids and alkalies. When the use of REXALLOY®™ in highly corrosive media other than those listed above is contemplated, specific inquiry is recommended, and testing should be done for your proposed application. Lead Oxide Corrosion Resistance: REXALLOY®™ has excellent resistance to lead oxide corrosion as shown by the following comparison: Lead Oxide Corrosion at 17001Ú4 F, Weight Loss — grams/sq. in./hr.

Describe an Airboat? An airboat is a water transportation vehicle and can be used for many purposes. The propeller of an airboat is used to achieve forward motion by turning up to 2800 RPM's. The propeller itself being an airfoil, while turning generates thrust directly out the stern of the airboat. The rearward thrust propels the airboat forward. All propulsion and navigation functions are in the air, not in the water, which gives the airboat capability of navigating on land or water provided that the airboat is constructed with a ultra high molecular plastic and or a polymer bottom and that the airboat has a sufficient thrust to weight ratio to move. You steer the airboat by a rudder or rudders positioned in the air stream at the rear of the boat. An airboat is a wind machine that is very similar to an airplane with respect to how it operates. Back to Top What are the advantages of having an Airboat? There are several advantages to having an airboat. An airboat can go just about anywhere on land or water that most ordinary boats can not. Airboats can operate in the shallow waters such as swamps and marshes or in deep waters. Airboats can go up to 70 miles per hour. Even faster on snow and ice if you DARE! The propulsion system on an airboat is never in the water, it is entirely above the water and any engine leaks would be collected in the bottom of the hull. Also the airboats do not project sound or vibration in the water like an ordinary boat would. The sounds made by an airboat occur at a low frequency, allowing a closer approach to wildlife. An airboat can be used for personal airboating, aquatic control, law enforcement, seismograph, hunting, and fishing and there are so many other reasons for owning an airboat. Back to Top What is a Airboat Belted Reduction Drive Unit? In 1989 Robert R. Eakin received a U.S. Patent for his invention which is the Airboat Belted Reduction Drive Unit. This drive unit is a belted transmission that was designed for airboats which will attach an automobile engine and the propeller. The belted drive unit allows the engine to achieve its maximum sustainable rpm's while turning the propeller at its normal rpm to increase thrust and reduce the noise levels. Century Drive Units Inc. continues today to manufacture the quality products that airboat users have come to expect and trust. Back to Top Why would it be better to have a Belted Reduction Drive Unit? Airboats can use belted reduction drive units to increase torque. By using a 2 to 1 ratio belted reduction, the auto engine will rev up to 5,200 RPM's while allowing the propeller to turn at 2,600 RPM's for more torque and greater power. With this belted reduction drive unit you will get the maximum torque transfer to turn your propeller. An engine with a belted reduction drive unit will swing a bigger propeller, a propeller with more blades, and a greater angle of attack or (more pitch). A wider, longer propeller turning lower RPM's will produce the same if not more thrust as a small propeller at high RPM's and produce far less noise. The key to a quieter airboat is to keep your tip speed as close to or under .6 mach. To calculate your tip speeds use the following formula:Diameter x RPM's ÷ 256,000 = mach Example: 82"" x 2000 RPM's ÷ 256,000 = .641 mach A belted reduction drive unit is the most cost effective method to use the horsepower produced. The performance of the airboat will increase by the amount of the ratio of reduction. Horsepower is constant and cannot be increased through a transmission, however you can increase torque output to the propeller, which makes for a faster and quieter airboat. Our belted reduction drive unit requires minimal maintenance. Back to Top How do you produce more torque and thrust at lower propeller RPM's with larger diameter propellers? You can achieve this by using a 2.3 to 1 ratio belted reduction drive unit from Century Drive Systems, Inc. There are other ratios available for you to choose from. For best results use a high performance engine with a roller cam and lifters designed to operate at 5000 RPM's. A marine or automotive engine with a belt reduction drive in combination with a composite wide blade propeller is an industry standard. Almost any mechanic can repair an automotive engine with a belted reduction drive unit. Back to Top What are the maintenance requirements for Airboat Belted Reduction Drive Units: Detailed instructions as follows: Back to Top How do I adjust the drive belt on my Airboat? Remove the 9 3/8"" - 16 hex cap screws from the upper assembly. Then while holding pressure inward turn the bearing holder clockwise to tighten the belt. Temporarily put in (4) 3/8"" - 16 x 1½"" cap screws. Then rotate the engine a few revolutions by hand without starting the engine, to center the belt. Check the belt tension by having a helper hold downward on the propeller tip to make a slack side to the belt. Then by feeling the amount of belt deflection. The belt should be snug but not drum tight. If your belt is too tight, you could cause premature pulley or bearing wear. Readjust to the proper tension, then put in all (9) 3/8"" - 16 cap screws and lock washers, then rotate through again and recheck. It is normal to hear some belt rumble between 600 - 850 RPM. If you hear a belt whine noise the belt is most likely to tight. Back to Top How do I grease my belted reduction drive unit for my airboat? Century Drive Systems, Inc. recommends using (2) pumps of Pennzoil Red Grease, Stock # 7772 or equivalent every 16 - 20 hours of unit operations. Apply grease in (2) upper bearings and (1) lower bearing with only (2) pumps per bearing using the recommended high-temperature bearing grease. (CAUTION: DO NOT OVER-GREASE BEARINGS) Adding too much grease may cause damage to the dust and grease seals which could result in premature wear. After 5 - 10 hours of operation, it is recommended that all drive unit bolts be re-torque and verify that the lower bearing set screw or ring clamp are still tight. For Counter Rotating Upper Assemblies:The first oil change on our Counter Rotator Upper Assemblies should be done after (20) hours of breaking time and then we recommend changing your unit oil every (6) months or (100) hours of use. Do not forget you still must give the lower bearing (2) pumps of grease every 16 - 20 hours. Back to Top How do I remove the Outboard Lower Bearing? Unbolt the bearing by removing the (4) 3/8"" - 16 x 2"" cap screws and loosen either the set screw bearing (SFC-24) or remove the lock ring bearing (SFC-24TC). Polish any exposed shaft area out past the bearing to remove any rust. Then apply some penetrating oil to help remove the inner race of the bearing remove from the shaft. Rotate the outer flange portion of the bearing so that the (4) holes are not over the (4) tapped holes in the main case to avoid damaging the case threads when removing the bearing. All (4) holes in the bearing flange that is used to bolt the bearing on have ½ - 13 NC threads inside. Use (4) pieces of ½"" - 13 x 5"" long all thread with (2) nuts jammed together on one end of each to act as draw bolts turning all (4) all thread equally to draw the bearing off the shaft. Be sure to only turn draw bolts (1) revolution each at a time. NOTE: You may need (2) aluminum shims about 1/8"" thick to place on the inside of the housing between the end face of the lower pulley and the housing. This will give the pulley a positive stop and keep you from bending your flexplate. Once the bearing is off the shaft, you should verify the shaft size. Our specifications on the shaft end is 1.4995 diameter + .0002 - .0000. You may still use the same shaft with as much as .002 undersize as long as you are sure that either the set screws or lock ring on the bearing are firmly secured to the shaft to keep the shaft from spinning inside of the bearing's inner race.

The liquid combined with grades of molochite granules, starting with fine through to coarser grades are built up over several layers over the wax sculpture, and is finally backed up with a fibre glass matting to ensure an extremely hard and strong ceramic shell around the wax.  The inside cavity of the hollow wax is filled with a plaster-based mixture called Core.  The wax is then melted out of the ceramic shell using heat directly applied to the shell using a propane burner. This now hollow ceramic shell, with the detailed impression within that the wax has produced, is now ready to receive the molten bronze.

The points of contact for the sprue system, (i.e. where the bronze sprues contact the sculpture) and the welded joins are worked back by our highly skilled Chasers - using the combination of specialist tools and many years of experience.  Their highly skilled workmanship ensures that there is no visible trace of sprue points or joins on the sculpture remaining.  It is at this point again, we ask you the artist to come and inspect the work, to ensure that your casting has been faithfully produced, and to make any minor alterations if required before the final patination, which would usually be carried out on the same occasion.

817,"Chippewa Brass & Aluminum Foundry History Chippewa Brass and Aluminum Foundry has been making quality castings since 1953 in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. History The foundry was started in 1953 by Anton Kahlen to make parts for W.S. Darley, a local fire truck manufacturer.  Anton was a native of Denmark who worked in South America before moving to the United States.  While in South America one of his many jobs was in a foundry.  When he moved to Chippewa Falls he went to work for W.S. Darley.  With his foundry experience, he decided to start a foundry to supply W.S. Darley with castings for their fire trucks.  He hired a co-worker's son, Earl Melville, to help him build the building and start the foundry.  After 9 years, Anton wanted to retire and sold the business to Earl.  The business has been owned by the Melville family since that time.  We still supply castings to W.S. Darley, but have expanded to supply castings to a wide variety businesses nationwide. Powered bySquarespace ",994,169

Muir is a local third generation Montanan specializing in western and wildlife sculptures. He resides on the beautiful shores of Flathead Lake and finds inspiration by all of the surrounding wildlife in the valley. Jack's business association with many well known and respected artists for the past 35 years has been a tremendously rich education and influence in his own art work. Western, wildlife and equestrian are themes that prevail in Jack's work. However, subject matter is secondary to his main interest which is to focus on strong sculptural elements. Muir's sculptures exude emotion through subject matter and interest to the eye by use of composition, movement and texture. Jack's sculptures can be found in private collections throughout the United States, Canada and Europe and are available in fine art galleries across the country.

""Sitting Grizzly Bear"" ""Tundra Swans"" Sherry Sander http://www.sherrysanderstudios.com Animal Sculptor Sherry Salari Sander resides in the Montana Countryside surrounded by a 300-acre wildlife preserve, the setting for her home and studio. She draws much inspiration from animals seeking protection there as well as from extensive travel and field research ranging from the Alaskan bush to the African plains. Sander strives to foster an appreciation for declining wildlife populations and the desire to preserve their habitat.""My work represents a lifelong love affair with animals and art. Observing and interpreting animals in their natural environment reveals those subtle behaviors most worthy of telling. By incorporating habitat, I challenge my compositions to respectfully capture an animal's interplay with nature, its gestures and personalities, hopefully, within an artful framework of balance, continuity and contrast."" Deborah Copenhaver Fellows http://www.fellowsstudios.com Deborah Copenhaver was born and raised on a cattle and Quarter Horse ranch in northern Idaho. Deborah received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with a Fine Art major following study in Italy where her passion for sculpture came alive and continues today. At 19 she sculpted her first commissioned bronze for the city of Spokane, James Glover. During a stay in Phoenix, Arizona she went to Prescott and met Ernie Phippen who ran a western art foundry.  Her world came together.  She went back home gathered all of her belongings and returned to Prescott to get a job as a head wrangler in a dude ranch.  That year she cast her first bronze and started her art career. Within four years Deborah was commissioned by Gonzaga University to sculpt a monument of Bing Crosby.  It was during this period Deborah married and had her only child, Fabienne, “my greatest life’s accomplishment,” according to Deborah. Living now in southern Arizona with her husband Fred Fellows, Deborah is devoted to creating fresh, original and accomplished sculptures which express her heartfelt feelings for the Western way of life. Surrounded by splendid Southwestern scenery and a string of good horses, she is assured an ample source of inspiration for a lifetime. ""Runt of the Litter"" ""The Untouchables"" Karl Lansing https://www.bronzewildlifesculptures.com Karl Lansing was raised in the majestic Northern Rockies of his native British Columbia. Since the age of 12, Karl has been a taxidermist and involved in the outfitting and guide business. He truly knows his subjects inside and out. When Karl's job in the mines in the Kootenay Region of British Columbia came to an end in the early 1990's, he decided to pursue a career with his art. He tackled two things he felt were missing in other sculptors' work: anatomical correctness and realistic detail. Karl is an avid outdoorsman and sports enthusiast, as well as a family man. Sculpting has become a natural extension for him to portray the impact that wilderness and wildlife have in his life. He thoroughly enjoys the challenging and ever changing career that he has chosen. Through the many diverse shows and conventions that he attends, he has found many lifelong friends who also share his enthusiasm for the great outdoors. Karl's continuous self-scrutiny, help him move forward in his constant quest for life-like realism in his work. This is evident in the care and precision that goes into the creation of each piece. This quality and precise detail is what sets his work apart and keeps his collectors coming back for more. He particularly enjoys working with clients on finding that unique piece that will work for them in their home or office, or outside their home or office! Jerry MCKellar https://jerrymckellar.com Jerry McKellar is primarily a self-taught artist and Army veteran; his vivid imagination combined with input from life experiences, travel, and nature influence his creative spirit. While studying Dentistry at the University of Washington he began making jewelry, and continued to experiment with various art forms including painting, scratch board drawing, and sculpting throughout his dental career. In 1987, he began to seriously pursue sculpting in bronze and retired from dentistry in 1994 to pursue his art career full time. Jerry has taken patina classes and expanded on that knowledge with years of experimentation; he does most of his own patina, including on his life-size monuments and larger sculptures.McKellar's sculptures are noted for strong compositions, power, and movement. As an accomplished and inventive artist, he is constantly broadening his style and subject matter. His work varies from extremely fine detail to smooth muscle studies emphasizing the human form, ranging in size from miniature to monumental. His work can be found in private collections and permanently in museums, corporations, and communities. Jerry and his wife, Gayle, have been residing in Colville, WA since 1971. ""When Wealth Was Pelts"" ""Above the Salmon River"" Reg Parsons http://www.regparsonsart.com ""Nature has always amazed me and as a young boy I painted western scenery and wildlife and grew up with a wish to express the beauty that I saw through those young eyes. I realize now that my life's journey has taken me back to that young boy's heart, to embrace the gifts that were given to me from the start.""Growing up in southern Alberta, his school notebook margins were filled with sketches of wildlife and horses. The spring of 1997 brought with it a new challenge to sculpt wildlife, to be cast in bronze. His understanding of nature, and the anatomy of wildlife, is evident in the life that he captures in each sculpture.  Subjects such as the Golden Eagle, North American wildlife, the Western Rodeo Series, the Lab Puppy Series, the impressionist Series of Creation, and his whimsical pieces that bring a smile, demonstrate his versatility as a sculptor. His work is original, and appealing to a wide range of art lovers. With unlimited talent as a self-taught artist, he looks forward to his next work being his best, and demands excellence in everything he puts his hand to. Reg Parsons has often said, “Creating life in Bronze and Fine Art that expresses beauty, passion and strength makes me come alive” Tom HJorleifson http://tomhjorleifson.com Tom Hjorleifson works in his studio in Canmore, Alberta, creating sculpture in a range of scales from hand-held to monumental, in bronze and stainless steel. Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Tom spent his formative years in Winnipeg and then Calgary. The YMCA played an important part in his early personal and leadership development; extensive world travels added to his experience. In 1980, after graduating from the University of Calgary with a BPE specializing in Outdoor Pursuits, Tom moved to Canmore where he currently resides with his wife and assistant Patricia. A self-taught sculptor, Tom began creating work in clay in 1990. He became a member of the Canmore Artist and Artisans Guild in 1992. His work is found in private and corporate collections around the world. Bronze is his preferred medium, but he also works in steel, stone and clay. ""The Rocky Mountain wilderness inspires my work. Personal encounters with wildlife evoke a deep passion, a desire to capture the magic of those moments. Hopefully, the work will promote the importance of the environmental movement."" For Tom, creating art is a compelling process, an exciting, irresistible journey. ""Bathing Beauty"" ""Iron Horse"" Scott Lennard http://www.scottlennard.com Scott grew up in southern Michigan with childhood visions of becoming a mountain man. In 1981 he fulfilled part of his boyhood dream by moving, with his wife Patti, to central Montana. After exploring the state for 4 years they settled in the rural community of Libby where together they opened Frontier Studio, a full service taxidermy shop. Scott's abilities as an artist and outdoors man have earned him many awards in the field of taxidermy. Working with wildlife in the realm of taxidermy eventually led to sculpting taxidermy manikins for the taxidermy industry. Scott discovered he really enjoyed the art of sculpting and soon became interested in trying his hand at bronze art work. It wasn't long before he added another name to his business; Scott Lennard Bronze Wildlife Sculpture Studio. In 1991 Scott completed his first bronze sculpture and was instantly hooked on this method of creative expression. From 1991 to 1997 Scott split his time between taxidermy and bronze art. Over the years Scott has continued to work in the areas of bronze art, taxidermy and sculpting forms for the taxidermy industry. He feels fortunate to have had the opportunity to center his career life around areas he passionately enjoys. Terry Lee http://www.terryleeart.com Born and raised in Coeur d' Alene, Idaho, Terry Lee could be considered a jack of all trades. His family owned and was involved in many businesses from farming to sporting goods and drive-in movie theaters. Terry broke into the art scene in 1994. Terry has created a truly unique style, reflecting a combination of the old masters and bringing new energy to wildlife art with bold usage of color. Recognizing the value to himself and other artists in the community, he opened a large studio two nights a week to Life Drawing and Sculpting sessions, providing the model and space to those who are interested in working with the human figure. ""I do my best to create a sense of energy and action. I capture emotional moments using color and light, sweeping brush strokes and bold swaths of color, drawing the eye into the scene. I want the viewer to feel the intense light and heat of the sun, creating atmosphere and mood. I believe in channeling my creative urges in order to produce unique artwork in Hayden. My inspiration for my work is the miracle of life. Terry Lee Studio is born out of a combination of my education, training and experience, which allows my perspective as an artist to remain traditional yet contemporary. Art is how I battle against the indifference of humans and offer new ways of viewing the world.” ""Slim"" ""Long Horn"" Rochelle Lombardi http://goingtothesungallery.org Rochelle is the owner of Going To The Sun Gallery in Whitefish, MT.

822,"BERGSTROM FOUNDRY INC. Axel Bergstrom originally founded Bergstrom Foundry in 1926 along with his two sons Conrad and Lloyd at the foot of ""F"" street in Aberdeen, Washington.  Bergstrom produced Cast Iron, Brass, and Bronze castings for the Logging & Sawmill industry in the area as well as sewer and drain covers for the cities of Hoquiam and Aberdeen.  They ran the foundry until the early 1930's when like a lot of other businesses they closed the doors due to the depression.   Axel and his sons went to work and ran the Lamb Foundry until 1940 when the Foundry was leased to the Long Brothers of Tacoma and became Long Foundry.  In August of 1945 Axel came out of retirement, and with his son Lloyd, built and started the second Bergstrom Foundry Co. located in Hoquiam, Washington (right next door to Aberdeen) producing Aluminum, Brass, and Bronze castings.  Axel Bergstrom retired in late 1960 after 62 years in the foundry industry.  Lloyd Bergstrom continued to run the Foundry until 1962 when his son-in-law Kenneth Miller took over the foundry.  Ken owned and operated the foundry until 1989.  In April of 1989 Bergstrom Foundry Co. was sold to Donald Little, Ken's nephew, and was Incorporated.  Don owned and operated the Foundry until December of 1993 when Bergstrom Foundry, Inc. purchased Peterson Foundry in Seattle, Washington.  At that time two partners, Martin Hauso who was working as the Foundry Foreman at Bergstrom, and Bill Newman who was working for Lamb-Grays Harbor joined the firm.  Both Foundries were operated separately until June of 1994 when they were combined at the present 10,000 sq. ft location on State Street in Aberdeen, right around the corner from the original 1926 location on ""F"" street.   Bergstrom Foundry's has seen a lot of changes in the foundry industry over the years and has grown from the solid foundation that Axel Bergstrom set down 90 years ago.

844,"Aluminum Casting Our process begins long before molds begin to be cut when take our customers through our Design for Castability process with our talented engineering team. This process ensures that part designs are optimized for the casting process which means you get the best result when it comes time for parts to be poured. Often product improvements such as reduced weight, stronger designs, and reduced costs result from this process. With an optimized design in hand we work with a vetted global supply base to get tooling at the right blend of quality and cost. The right tooling is as critical to good parts as a good castable design. Once the foundation is setup we are ready to begin first articles and processing parts in our new state-of-the-art foundry. With multiple custom built die parters, tilt pour machines, and eight high-capacity furnaces, we can meet your high-volume needs. We are also more equipped than others with investments in the best quality assurance technologies available on the market such as stress and destructive testing devices, real-time x-ray, and augmented reality CMM equipment (we like to sleep well at night).

844,"Since 1949… Started in 1949 by two innovative, tinkering brothers named Lynn and Russ (LR). These brothers had lived through the Great Depression and World War II and throughout their lives had developed a driving curiosity about how things worked. So they combined their experience and started Marco Products which focused on building unique products for local industrial customers. This new found adventure enabled them to tinker and also support their young, growing families. Marco Products eventually became Lynrus Corporation when they brought on investors in the late 1960’s then at the turn of the century became Lynrus Aluminum Products when Russ Margetts, Russ Senior’s son, took over operations of the business. After nearly 20 years of exciting growth and new opportunities, Russ sold the company to his son Tyler who is the current owner. In the transition of ownership the company started anew as LR Dynamics. “LR” hails back to the original founders Lynn and Russ and represents a stewardship of a great legacy of hard work and innovation. “Dynamics” represents forward motion and positive change that is the goal of the third generation of family owners.

859,"HTCi Home About About HTCi The HTCi Quality Difference The HTCi Team Location and Directions Products Products Markets Served Services News & Resources Contact Products HTCI, Co. specializes in high quality complex castings, using three types of molding processes in the production of our castings. We serve a wide variety of casting markets, including those with the most demanding requirements and specifications, such as aerospace and OEM and automotive.  HTCI, Co. Mold Processes: Plaster Mold Process HTCI's ability to use the plaster mold process is unique in the industry. We have perfected this process to provide precision castings for aerospace, automotive, and other commercial needs and it consists of the following steps:   Plaster Mold ToolingPlaster Mold With Core Installed   Tooling:  Patterns are built out of water resistant materials, such as urethane, and mounted on cope and drag plates. Core boxes are developed when required from the same materials.  Plaster Mold:  Once the patterns are created, they are set-up as needed and a specially formulated plaster slurry is poured over them to form the upper and lower mold portions.  Cores:  If the part requires cores (to create passageways, etc.), a special plaster slurry is poured into a core box. When the plaster hardens, the core is removed from the box.  Mold Assembly:  Mold sections and cores are assembled to create the complete mold. This mold is then baked in ovens to remove any moisture from the mold.  Pouring Metal:  After bake-out, molten metal is poured into the molds.  Plaster Removal:  After the metal has solidified and cooled, the molds are broken away by vibration or high pressure water blasts. The castings are then cut from the gate and deburred.  Solid Mold Investment Process  The Solid Mold Investment casting process (aka Lost Wax process) is an economical way to produce high quality castings using a wax pattern.     Tooling:  Metal dies, usually aluminum, are produced from the customer's specifications.  Wax Injection:  High pressure injection systems fill the cavity in the dies with wax, producing a pattern.  Assembly:  Wax patterns are attached to gating (flow channels) and mounted to an aluminum plate.  Plaster Slurry:  Plaster slurry is poured over the wax pattern in a vacuum chamber to form a mold.  Burn-Out:  After the molds are created, the wax is melted out using a gas-fired dewax furnace.  Pouring Metal:  The ""void"" left by the wax will be filled by molten metal.  Plaster Removal:  After the metal has solidified and cooled, the molds are broken away by vibration or high pressure water blasts. The castings are then cut from the gate and deburred.  Precision Sand Process   Precision sand is an effective way to produce high quality castings using a no-bake sand mold.   Tooling:  Patterns are built using urethane tooling. Core boxes are developed when required.  Sand Mold:  Once the patterns are created, sand is mixed via an automatic mixing system using a specific percentage of airset binder. They are set-up as needed and the sand mixture is poured in them to form the upper and lower mold portions.  Cores:  If the part requires cores (to create passageways, etc.), core blowing machines blow sand into core boxes. The machine has a mixture of sand and chemical hardener that allows the sand to harden quickly.  Mold Assembly:  Mold sections and cores are assembled to create the complete mold.  Pouring Metal:  The molten metal is poured into the molds.  Sand Removal:  After the metal has solidified and cooled, the molds are broken away by vibration. The castings are then cut from the gate and deburred.  Technical Design Data  Cast Alloys HTCI, Co. can meet the requirements of the majority of material specifications available, including MIL-A-21180.Aluminum Alloys319, 356, 357, 380, 535 (Almag 35)C355, 203 (RR-350)  Tolerances Normal cast tolerances are ± 0.01 for the first inch and then ± 0.005 inch per inch thereafter.  Closer tolerances are available on selected dimensions.  Because cost increases in proportion to dimensional requirements, it is important that tight tolerances be assigned to functional areas and other tolerances be generous to obtain the most economical design. The following table indicates what generally can be held.  Tolerances for geometric tolerancing are in proportion to the linear tolerances above.    Basic linear tolerance E1 call outs represent tolerances on one side of the parting line only. For dimensions that cross the parting line add E2 to E1. For dimensions including features in both the mold itself and in core add E3 to E1 and/or E2. The amount of additional tolerance for E2 and E3 is determined by the projected area of either the casting at the parting line for E2 or the projected area of the core in contact with the casting for E3. For dimensions which cross the parting line, defined in part by core or are in some other way additive, these tolerances may require some expansion. The foundry should be consulted and good judgment is recommended.    Ready to work with us?

As a result, customers can be assured of cost reductions to help all but eliminate timely delays typical from working with outside pattern manufacturing facilities. Tooling In most instances HTCI Co. can address our customers' tooling and manufacturing requirements, in-house. As a result, customers can expect shorter lead times on projects, as well as, improved revision implementation lead times.   Rapid Prototyping Rapid Prototyping (RP) is an innovative service that accelerates product development through the use of a 3D CAD file and advanced laser and machining technology such as 3-D printing and stereolithography. It is used to fabricate physical objects (prototypes) using CAD data and allows us to quickly test a design before moving forward with expense and time required for the investment or ceramic mold casting process. At times, it is also used to create single replacement parts for machinery that is out of production.  Our rapid prototyping services include:     Bridge Tooling Bridge tooling is used for short production castings.  RP models are duplicated into epoxy tooling. Machining To assist its clients with quick turn-around time, HTCI has a complete in-house machining facility. We have a vast array of equipment, including both 3-axis and 4-axis vertical machining centers (CNC). Castings can be purchased machined and ready for plating, assembly or anything else clients may require. In addition, we can supply prototypes machined from stock material such as 7075, 6061, etc.   Heat Treating Services HTCI provides “In House” Heat Treatment services for our customers' casting needs, including full Heat Treatment hardening or simply Stress Relief, using AMS-2770 certified equipment. Weld Repair Repair welding is a necessary operation to correct defects in castings such as cracks and/or other problems in order to safeguard against product failures. HTCI has extensive experience providing qualified welding repair procedures and personnel in accordance with specified codes, specifications and standards. Non-Destructive Testing According to theAmerican Foundry Society, Non-destructive testing (NDT) involves a variety of methods or tests that can assure the quality of a casting without destroying it. Because a single test to measure mechanical properties, chemical composition, casting soundness or maximum service loads of a casting does not exist, a combination of nondestructive methods is typically used to document the soundness and quality of a casting.   HTCI provides the following ""in-house"" testing services:      Mechanical Properties Testing HTCI provides “In House” Aerospace Industry Standards Metallurgical certification for Elemental Content as well as Physical Strength Properties, saving our clients time and expense.      Chemical Analysis The chemical structure of metal is one of the most critical properties that needs to be controlled during the production of castings. HTCI has a suite of analytical equipment in-house to verify the chemical composition of our metals and integrity of the finished product. Ready to work with us?

889,"Business Backup  Your Data is the most valuable part of your Computer or Corporate network. A functional, ongoing and offsite business backup solution should be essential in your business. Inadequate data asset protection through poorly managed and unreliable system backups leaves you and your company exposed to the potentially crippling event of data loss. We Suggest three levels of backup to ensure you are fully protected from all means of data loss from events such as: Any one of these three backup methods is good, all three will enable you to remain utterly confident that your data is safe. Volume Shadow Copy Volume Shadow Copy is a form of backup that is wholly integrated within new Windows computer systems. It is the simplest and quickest form of backup and requires minimal interaction in order to configure and monitor. It essentially takes a ‘snapshot’ of what your files contain at a particular point in time and saves them to a list in which you can restore from. This runs on a ‘per file’ basis and the snapshot process is usually run daily. Windows Server backup Windows Server Backup is another Windows integrated backup system which involves backing up your data to any number of external hard drives, which are switched each day accordingly. This form of backup in most cases takes an entire image of your server in order to allow for a complete system restoration in the case of a disaster. Offsite Backup ACS offers automatic, encrypted, offsite but easily recoverable backup solutions through our “ACSBackup” software. ACSBackup works over your existing internet connection to transfer your critical data to a secure server at ACS. This automated procedure can be set to run overnight so you or your staff do not have to manually switch out drives. Starter Backup Plans Business Backup Plans Please Note: Each account is licensed to serve one computer. Any additional computers (including network shares which you want to backup) will require additional licenses. Your entire backed-up store of data is transferred onto a portable USB Hard Drive and shipped to your office. Suitable for restoring larger data volumes over 20 GBytes, and useful for archiving.

901,"Turn onto Crystal Lake Ave heading west off of IL-31. After 1 mile, turn right onto Erick Street. Serv-All is the first industrial building on your left, at the intersection of Erick and Prairie Street. History Serv-All Die & Tool Company was started in 1945 by Thomas Groden, Bert Brogren, Lee Larson, and Art Schramm in the old Meier Dairy building in Crystal Lake, IL. It was a difficult task securing equipment when the nation was at war, but they were able to get the shop underway on a small scale. Later, the scope of production was able to increase with the war ending and conditions showing a steady improvement. We built die-cast dies and bakelite moulds for components in radios for one of our first customers, Motorola, located nearby. Soon after, because of demand, Serv-All bought our first die casting machine and started casting. Eventually, Tom Groden became the sole ownerand the family owns and runs the business to this day. Over the years, Serv-All has continued to grow and expand into larger facilities. Today The long standing family tradition is carried on today, with Serv-Allon its 3rdgeneration of family ownership. We continuewith our dedication to improve and be a world class manufacturer with vision, perseverance, and uncompromising commitment to high standards of doing business. This story continues 70 years later with a focus to anticipate and satisfy the ever-changing needs of our customers, who expect the very best. “Today, the company remains strong and continues to grow. It has strong financials and a strong leadership team at all levels.”  -Dan Johnson, President Gallery     Serv-All Die and Tool Co.110 Erick St. Crystal Lake, IL 60014PH: (815) 459-2900 Get Social ",1713,280

AND WHY DO YOU NEED IT The requirements issued by the National Electric Code (NEC) that a corrosion-resistant conductive structure with a surface area of at least 9 square inches must be installed in contact with the water and connected to the equipotential bonding grid.  This ensures that the pool water and the equipotential bonding grid have the same electrical potential.

919,"Perma-Cast Anodes Salt System Corrosion Salt System Swimming Pools: Sanitation of swimming pools using chlorine generators has become the method of choice for the pool professional. The addition of salt to the pool water creates a more corrosive environment for metals in the pool. A number of variables affect the actual corrosion of metals in pools. PH, water temperature, total alkalinity, chlorine levels, salt concentration levels and improper metal bonding can all contribute to corrosion of metals in the swimming pool. It is essential to maintain proper water balance with respect to PH, chlorine, and total alkalinity. Proper monitoring of salt concentration levels is critical in controlling metal corrosion. Salt levels should never exceed the maximum concentrations recommended by the Salt System Manufacturer. In addition, all metal components must be bonded according to accepted construction practices. Even with all these variables under control, metal corrosion in the salt pool is very likely. Additional methods of corrosion protection should be used to avoid problems. What is a Sacrificial Anode? A sacrificial metal anode is used to protect critical metal components in a salt system swimming pool. The sacrificial anode is connected electrically (either through direct contact or by use of a wire) to the metal to be protected. In a salt system pool, for example, a pool heater core will normally tend to corrode as a result of being in contact with the pool water. If this heater core is connected to a properly designed sacrificial anode, the anode will tend to corrode and transfer electrons to the heater core. At the interface between the pool water and heater core these electrons will create a chemical reaction that protects the heater core. The heater core (cathode) attracts electrons produced by the corroding sacrificial anode. The electrons react at the surface of the heater core with elements in the water. This reaction protects the heater core at the expense of the sacrificial anode. This transfer of electrons from the sacrificial anode to the metal to be protected is referred to as Cathodic protection. Examples of Sacrificial Anodes: All water heaters utilize sacrificial anodes to protect their steel tanks from corroding. The single most important factor in whether a water heater lives or dies is the condition of its sacrificial anode. Ships have anodes installed on their hulls to protect the steel hull from corroding in sea water. Lobster traps utilize sacrificial anodes to prevent corrosion on the ocean floor. Off shore oil rigs, buried pipelines, storage tanks, steel piers, and oil wells all utilize sacrificial anodes to prevent corrosion and premature failure of their critical components. Why use TechNodes: TechNodes are the result of research done by Scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology. TechNodes are sacrificial anodes designed specifically to protect critical metal components in Salt System Swimming Pools. TechNode In-line is designed to protect any metal components in the pools plumbing, including pool heaters and heat exchangers. Tech Node Ladder will protect pool ladders that are submerged in the swimming pool. Tech Node Light will prevent corrosion of metal components on underwater lights. TechNode Utility is designed to protect any other metal components in the swimming pool. TechNodes are cast from Mil Spec Zinc, have high surface area to volume characteristics resulting in the most efficient Pool Anodes on the market.

SPIN-CASTING Spin-casting is a prototype and short run zinc alloy casting process that enables engineers to review their designs, debug them, and proceed into production with confidence. The spin-casting process uses high temperature, vulcanized silicone rubber molds and centrifugal force to produce highly detailed, low porosity, medium density castings. The finished physical properties achieved using this process are the closest to die-cast properties available.  Spin-casting is an essential prototyping process for troubleshooting your engineering designs prior to investing in hard tooling.  It is also cost effective for low volume production requirements. As 4-slide simulation is standard, almost any die-casting design is suitable for spin-casting. ​ Spin-casting is the least expensive, fastest prototyping process available for zinc alloy parts. It also produces the very best representation of a finished die-cast part. Ideal quantities are fewer than 10 up to several thousand. For an in-depth description of the process, see ourspin-casting article. ​ ​ info@seybertcastings.com ",1994,268

We love it so much and it made us quite emotional that, without properly realising, her hands and feet are already so much bigger! It's a wonderful piece and so perfectly finished. We are so so pleased with it. Thank you for your care and attention throughout the process. It is stunning! And we have them face to face at our partners desk. We are very happy. Please thank your artisans and craftsmen, a truly special work for us! We wish you well and know whom to call if Elias Lincoln has a sibling. Everyone who we’ve shown my husband’s silver keychain to has been blown away by the technical skill and detail. It really is exquisite. Thanks so much. I have been so impressed by every stage of this commission and the unfailing attention to detail. The sculpture is fantastic! A Masterpiece. Thanks so much. Thank you for doing everything you could to get these tiny feet to me during such a terrible time in world history. You and your company are extremely professional, courteous and accommodating. Not to forget that the work you and your artists make is impeccable and perfect. You are making keepsakes that last a lifetime. I will certainly recommend you to those who are looking to have castings. I'm so happy with my Sculptures and so glad I went with Wrightson and Platt, as the process for me was of equal importance to the finished work.

The Sabeti family saw its business, its home, its capital and assets allseizedby the revolutionary guard before fleeing religious persecution and escaping toneighbouringPakistan. ​ This was just the first step in a journey that wouldeventuallysee them reunited with their son and daughter in the UK. Here they were able to start their business again, and afteryearsof hard work and sheer determination, build into thesuccessit is today. ​ Now Sabeti Wain is not only the worlds leading designer and manufacturer of aircraft seat covers, withproductionfacilities in  the UK, Dubai and America, it also represents the highest quality benchmark - effectively the standard that other manufacturers seek to emulate, and by which they are judged. ​ ​ Meet The Directors Paymen Sabeti ​ Operations Director ​ Nick Wain ​ TechnicalServices Director Mahnoush Sabeti-Wain ​ Business Services Director 'We are proud tohaveestablished a reputation in the aerospace industry as one of the leading designers and manufacturers of upholstery systems for airlines and seat manufacturers. This has been achieved by the hard work, encouragement and dedication of our parents Parvis and Mehrangiz Sabeti, as well as our dedicated and hard-working staff - some of whom are still part of our team 30 years on. ​ The directors of Sabeti Wain Aereospace acknowledge and sincerely thank all our customers and suppliers; who over the years have become part of one cohesive team working seamlessly to achieve the best results for all concerned. ​ The philosophy of the directors of the company has always been to consider work as form of service, always striving to push the boundaries of possibility, and as a means of providing livelihood for many people, both within the company and industry as a whole.'

Sabeti Wain has always had a strongcommitmenttominimisingits impacts on the environment. ​ Sabeti Wain Aerospace takes all possible steps to minimise its carbon footprint and where possible all waste materials are recycled, thiscommitmentis further underlined by the installation of 177 solar panels on the roof of the High Wycombe Facility. These generate power for the factory as well as allowing the company to sell surplus electricity back to the national grid. ​ The system saves over 27000KG of CO2 emissions each year, compared to generating the same amount of power by conventional means Sabeti Wain Aerospace and Sports ​ ​ Sabeti Wain Aerospace is a key sponsor of the Emirates Road Cycling Club (ERCC) which draws its members from Emirates Group staff and close family members. ​ Following major developments in Dubai's sporting facilities, it was announced that Dubai would host theInternationalCycling Union's Tour of Dubai in 2014. This new event in the international cycling calendar will follow from the Tour of Qatar and the Tour of Oman.

Once approved each cover is precisely hand cut by highly skilled cutters  before the vision is brought to life by specialised machinists, and hand finished with meticulous attention to detail. Each seat cover is manufactured from hand picked fabric, leather or hybrid materials sourced from the highest quality, environmentally friendly suppliers around the world. High quality,hand finished, perfectly executed seat covers paired with outstanding customer service is why Sabeti Wain Aerospace is the world leader in aircraft seat dress cover design and manufacture. ​ Hover over some of our bespoke designs to find out more about them. JetBlue A321 Neo ​ Both JetBlue’s Core and Even More Space seats feature a custom-made, E-leather dress cover designed by Acumen and manufactured by  Sabeti Wain. ​ The Core dress cover has been embellished with the airline’s distinctive blue branding, while the Even More Space seats feature a bold orange halo, highlighting the increase in seat pitch. The seats also include adjustable padded headrests , ensuring all customers have the required head and neck support. ​ Featured in The Design Air:https://thedesignair.net/2019/09/29/acumen-helps-deliver-jetblues-new-a321neo/ Emirates Business Class Boeing 777-300ER ​ The design brief was to create a special automotive look that had never been seen in aviation before, showcasing a Sabeti Wain Aerospace designed and produced seat dress cover and back foam. A refined and sleek-looking interior,  the design and shape of the Business Class seat is inspired by a modern Mercedez-Benz sports car with a diamond stitch pattern on the full leather cover and ergonomically designed headrest. Titan AirwaysS7 Business Class ​ Working alongside Acro Aircraft Seating, Sabeti Wain manufactured a distinctive chevron style dress cover which perfectly compliments the ergonomically designed seats with increased  leg room for added passenger in-flight comfort. Lamination ​ Sabeti Wain Aerospace Pioneered the development oflaminationtechnology. This Process allows customer-specific designs and styling features to be incorporated into seat covers. The lamination process enhances scope for styling in the seat, overallappearanceand increases durability andcomfort. ​ Sabeti Wain's unique approach means that laminated seat covers not only look better that traditional seat covers they also reduce the amount of foam used saving weight and cost withoutcompromisingon comfort. ​ The overall effect can be heightened further by the introduction of embossed airline logos on leather, fabric andcombinationseat covers. Auto Stitching ​ The addition of  Auto Stitch Machines at both Sabeti Wain Aerospace High Wycombe and Dubai has allowed for elaborate and decorative embroidery to be added to dress covers to compliment the cabin, highlighting certain patterns and features used throughout the aircraft interior and airlines marketing. ​ Bespoke embroidery designs are created digitally and uploaded to the sewing machine allowing for more precise and specialised stitching. The computerised sewing machine is more versatile than the traditional machine being able to stitch on fabric, leather and combination seat covers with little to no adjustment . Evolving Seat Cover Design ​ Theindustry-wide quest for savings is reflected in the evolving airlines seat cover design. Apart from comfort and compliance with safety regulations, two important considerations for airline operators are that seat covers are quick and easy to change, and that they are as light as possible. ​ Sabeti Wain Aerospace manufactures seat covers in fabric, leather and in combination or hybrid designs, and adapts to changing materials technology, so that the airline operators can benefitimmediatelyfrom advances in weight saving, durability and ease of maintenance. ​ Qatar Airways Q Suite ​ Unveiled by Qatar Airways in 2017 the Q Suite revolutionised business class air travel , the first suite-style business class seats, complete with closing doors and a layout that could be configured for a four person family or work areas, and even double beds. ​ Qatar Airways are the driving force in elevating passenger experience within air travel. Aeroflot A350 Horizon  Aeroflot boasts Auto Stitching on their Horizon dress covers, reflecting the wave theme within the Horizon Suite entry doors and the over head lights in the Business Class bars welcome area. Malaysian Airlines A350-900 First Class  Geometric Auto Stitching adds a sophisticated and on trend look complimenting the clean lines and colour palette used within the cabin. Quick Change Seat Covers ​ This design breakthrough pioneered by Sabeti Wain Aerospace was made possible because of the increased rigidity of laminated seat covers.Laminatedseat covers can be held in place by fewer anchor points compared to traditional covers because of the more rigid shape. ​ This fixing method meant that cover change times could be reduced for 15 minutes to just 4, this reduces the timescales drastically for total refits and cuts overall downtime for operators. ​ The increasing size of aircraft and seat numbers, means changing seat covers can cost operators a great deal of time, money and inconvenience. For obvious economic reasons, any downtime has to be avoided. Etihad Economy ​ Etihad introduce a new seat products in the economy class cabins of both aircraft using “Extra-spacial Design” seats developed by UK-based manufacturer, Acro and manufactured by Sabeti Wain Aerospace. These new seats will maintain comfortable ‘living space’ in the seat area, and provide increased knee room. FREE Design Workshops ​ Sabeti Wain Aerospace offer FREE design workshops, making the vision a realitythoughengineering, partnership and collaboration. British Airways Short Haul The elegant charcoal grey leather seats are slimmer and ergonomically designed to enable the addition of extra seats in the Euro Traveller cabin to allow more low fares. A four way moveable headrest provides comfort and support, an embossed logo in the center of the headrest further heightens the overall cabin design. Singapore Airlines Premium Economy A collaboration between JPA Design, Zim Flugsitz GmbH and Sabeti Wain Aerospace has resulted in the stylish new Singapore Airlines Premium Economy Seat.  An all leather design reflected in both the Business and First class seats makes the premium economy seat feel like it belongs within the new cabin upgrade. The cross hatching padding with orange accents are a stark contrast against the grey colour pallet used, paired with the bright orange cushions provided  add character to the over all look. SouthWest Meridian ​ SouthWest Meridian seats are designed to be lighter, with enhanced cushion comfort and more personal space per passenger. The E-Leather allows for a sleek finish and debuts a new colour as part of SouthWest's heart re branding campaign. Ergonomics ​ Sabeti Wain Aerospace uses ergonomics in every aspect of product design and development. With over 30 yearsexperiencewithin the industry, custom methods have been developed to optimise long-term durability and comfort within all products,incorporatingthe use of new technology such as pressure mapping. Lightweight Seat Covers ​ Weight is an important driver of evolving design in aircraft interiors due to economy and fuel consumption. For one customer Sabeti Wain Aerospace redesigned their seat covers resulting in them being 2KG lighter than theexistingones, withoutcompromisingon passenger comfort. ​ Sabeti Wain works directly with customers to meet other specific designchallenges, resulting in some innovativesolutionsdelivering cost saving and other operational advantages.

Having a singlespecialistsupplier for all foam components ensures a perfect match between the cover and the seat every time.With both elements being produced in tandem, there is potential for exciting design innovation, paving the way for better-fitted, smarter interiors for airlinesoperators- and enhanced comfort for passengers and crew. Emirates Business Class Boeing 777-300ER ​ With a Sabeti Wain Aerospace designed and produced back foam the dress cover is able to sit tightly within the side bolsters while still being fully removable, perfectly demonstrating the advantages of a single specialist supplier for foam components and seat dress covers. Transatlantic JetBlue Mint ​ The newly revealed, transatlantic version of JetBlue Mint, showcases a mattress cushion using Tuft & Needle proprietary foam technology, fabricated by Sabeti Wain Aerospace, integrated with a Sabeti Wain Aerospace breathable soft look Dress Cover. This amalgamation has created a cool and comfortable sleep experience as well as being responsive to passenger movements, and accommodating those who prefer a softer or firmer mattress.

ASTM / EN Specification Cross Reference Guide,CLICK HERE Additional Tools & Resources Copper Development Association (CDA) - High-Speed Machining In response to continuing pressures placed on brass consumers to be competitive, and to offset many of the challenges associated with alternative lead free alloy options, the Copper Development Association (CDA initiated a multi-phase study to challenge current conventional machining paradigms and investigate the potential and merits of machining brass at higher speeds. With its long-standing tenure as an industry leader in the brass rod industry, Mueller Brass Company offered its expertise and experience as a contributing participant in this study. Also participating in this study were companies representing other aspects of manufacturing ranging from tooling companies to machine builders. Although the study is not yet fully completed, some preliminary findings and compelling observations support and lend credence to the ability and merits of machining brass rod material at higher than conventional speeds. Concurrently, with these higher speeds are merits and contributions, which will inevitably aid manufacturers with competitive pressures, but also lead to additional opportunities by converting other materials to brass. As a resource to our existing and future customers, Mueller Brass is providing below, a link to CDA’s website (www.highspeedmachiningbrass.com). The website not only compiles and summarizes the potential and merits realized when machining brass at higher speeds, but also substantiates these theories through a repository of compelling videos, white papers and case studies (all available for download).

Copper Development Association (CDA) - Properties of Wrought and Cast Copper Alloys In addition to the literature on the alloys produced by Mueller Brass Company, another valuable resource is the Copper Development Association’s “Properties of Wrought and Cast Copper Alloys” database. From standard alloys like C36000 Free Cutting Brass to Newly developed alloys like Mueller Brass Company’s C27450 Lead Free Brass, CDA’s database is a comprehensive and searchable compilation of hundreds of wrought and cast copper alloys and their respective chemistries and properties. This resource is free to the public and can be accessed by clicking the following link: www.copper.org/resources/properties/db/CDAPropertiesSelectionServlet.jsp?mode=basic Application Data Sheets – Copper Development Association Why use brass?? Aside from the obvious merits of using brass alloys that range from aesthetics to corrosion resistance, one aspect when determining which material to use is cost. Because the issue of cost is such an important aspect on part design and material selection, the Copper Development Association has performed case studies where some typically non-brass parts were made with C36000 free cutting brass. The case studies in this section provide anecdotal examples and comparative benefits from manufacturing the part from brass. (Note: Costs of both brass and ‘non-brass materials (i.e. steel, aluminum, etc.) fluctuate with market conditions; but the assumptions made in these case studies are consistent with prices that have existed over the years. There is no intent to imply the prices assumed here are current; however, they reasonably represent the metals relative to market prices.) © 2022 Mueller Brass Co.  //  A Company ofMueller Industries, Inc.

Commitment and dedication to our customers, and their individual needs allowed our company’s presence to grow stronger in the United States. With that growth, our services grew to include assembled Front Steer Axle Modules for: commercial vehicles, recreational vehicles, as well as other various axles for construction vehicles. Through the success of Westport’s Axle Division, came the inception of our Logistics Division. In 2005 Westport introduced its Logistics Division by providing Supply chain Services such as Component Integration, Broadcast Sequencing, ILVS, and other high demand services in 4 states across the eastern half of North America. In 2008, the Logistics Division increased their Supply Chain Service capabilities by introducing and opening Kitting and Metering facilities in Avon, Ohio. As Westport’s Supply Chain Services and Logistics Customers continued to expand, our company’s core business of Axle Assembly also grew. That same year Westport opened a 205,000 square foot Axle Assembly facility in Roanoke, Virginia providing service to Volvo. Also in 2008, Westport again expanded and opened a Manufacturing Division in Louisville, Kentucky where we machine components for the commercial vehicles market. In the summer of 2012, Westport opened up a Chassis Assembly Plant in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania servicing Mack. To date, the 3 divisions of Westport continue to thrive. Our dedicated work forces at all of our facilities across the United States strive daily to achieve quality, value, service, and continuous improvement for our customers with an added focus on lean efficiencies, and our ever present awareness to the conservation, and protection of the environment. It is through this dedication that Westport and its employees truly define the meaning of customer partnership, and our constant commitment to it.

946,"The History of United P&HSupply Company United Plumbing & Heating Supply Company,founded by George J. Roska Sr. and two partners,  arrived on the Milwaukee  scene in 1922—selling exclusively to plumbing and heating contractors. An  outgoing and industrious man, George headed the company as president and sales  manager. He died suddenly in 1932, leaving the majority stock to his wife and  young children. Throughout the Great Depression and World War II, Mrs. Roska  held on to that stock, although the family could have avoided much hardship by  selling it. George's son, George Jr.,worked for the company after high school  graduation in 1938. When World War II broke out, he and his brother, Roy, joined the armed  services. Roy  was a Marine fighter pilot, and George Jr. served in the U.S. Army Air Corps.  After they were discharged, the two men, and brother Norm, purchased the stock  of the minority partners and took over management of the business. Roy became President and  Sales Manager; George, General Manager and Secretary-Treasurer; Norm,  Vice-President and Warehouse Manager. Under the leadership of the three  brothers, United grew steadily during the 50's. In 1962, United added an Industrial Division,headed by Roy,  to sell pipe, valves, fittings (PVF) and related products to manufacturers,  utilities, institutions and municipalities in the Greater Milwaukee Area. Following graduation  from Texas Christian  University,four years of service in the Naval Air Reserve  and a short stint in public relations, George Jr.’s son,Chip, joined United's Industrial Division in 1977, when Roy became seriously ill. To grow the  business, Roy,  George and Chip decided to expand the Industrial Division's operations into the  rest of the state by finding specialty product lines that were unique, employed  selective distribution, and required a high level of sales expertise. When Roy died in 1980, Chip  picked up the torch as Sales Manager. The Industrial Division continued to  prosper. Chip's younger brother, Paul,an Auburn   University graduate,  joined the company in 1981, as Purchasing Manager, after serving as an  Assistant Engineer at a nuclear power plant. His technical background prepared  him to effectively steer United's increased use of computer technology to best  advantage. By 1986, the Industrial  Division had grown enough to spin off a separate Technical  Divisionto market engineered products, including:  high-performance valves, valve automation, steam traps, automatic continuous  blowdown systems, steam specialties, jet pumps, and flow and level instruments,  in Wisconsin and Upper   Michigan. ""Tech"" developed a “Mod Shop” for the  installation of actuators and controls on valves. While the Technical Division  continued to work with much of the Industrial Division’s customer base, it  placed additional focus on the pulp and paper industry in the Fox and Wisconsin River Valleys. Keeping up with the  industry's advancements in computer technology,United switched over to theEclipseoperating platform, in March of 1999. Integrating all facets of the company's  operations, Eclipse also enabled the company to utilize Palm Pilots and bar  coding for Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI). To improve customer service, United  hired a logistics manager, Rick Chojnacki, a Cardinal Stritch   University grad, to  assume responsibility for warehouse logistics, delivery, and to assist with  inventory management and process improvement.  Rick had acquired expertise  in these areas during prior employment with Wisconsin Electric and Master Lock. February 1, 2000, George Roska retiredfrom United P&H after 61 years of service.  He relinquished his roles as President and Treasurer to become chairman of the  board. The board of directors elected Chip Roska, President and General  Manager, and Paul Roska, Vice-President Operations and Inventory Manager. Rick  Chojnackiwas appointed VP-Logistics Design, in July of 2004, to reflect his leadership and  contribution within the company. In June of 2007, Paulmoved to Florida to embark on a new career. In October of 2008, several appointments were made:Rick Chojnacki, VP/Operations and Assistant GM; Tom Hudson, VP-Sales and Industrial Division Manager; and Jeff Zawicki, VP-Purchasing and Plumbing Division Manager. In April of 2014,Rick Chojnacki was appointed President/GM, and Chip Roska, CEO. In  May of 2017,United made the historic decision to close its Plumbing  Division (established in 1922)-- curtailing the sale of plumbing  fixtures, faucets and water heaters, to focus all assets exclusively on  Industrial PVF, Technical Products, and to establish a new Sanitary  Products Group aimed at Wisconsin's prolific Food, Beverage and  Pharmaceutical Markets. Although, the Plumbing Division was shut  down, United  continues to provide many ancillary plumbing products  such as fittings/connections, drainage products, plumbing valves and  pumps, to its industrial, utility, institutional and municipal  customers. United's  purchasing and marketing strength has been greatly enhanced through  membership in North America's largest buying and marketing groupAffiliated Distributors (A-D). A-D is a $34-billion organization, comprised of our industry's top  independent distributors and suppliers, and is committed to enhancing  profitability and increasing market share for its members. Employing a  responsive, flexible, highly experienced and well-trained sales force,  an unmatched product range and state of the art technology, United is  poised to move into the future. ",5577,808

948,"Shultz Steel Remelting With in house re-melting, Shultz Steel is positioned to control raw materials and deliveries. Shultz Steel Company's raw materials are primarily vacuum arc remelted steels, titanium alloys and nickel base alloys. Conventionally melted and cast aluminum ingot is also used. In 1996, Shultz Steel installed its own Vacuum Arc Remelting (VAR) facility for the remelting of steel and nickel alloy ingots. This new facility requires the procurement of cast electrodes melted in an electric arc furnace or vacuum induction furnace. Subsequent VAR melting at Shultz Steel converts these electrodes into Aerospace quality ingots. Ingots are cylindrical in nature (from 20 to 40 inches diameter), weighing from 10,000 lbs.(titanium and aluminum) up to 40,000 lbs. (steel). These ingots are initially heated and open die forged in three or four operations to a billet product. This billet product is subsequently examined and inspected to verify its eternal and internal quality. The billet material is subsequently saw cut into specific weights (""Mults"") for the manufacture of open or closed die forgings. This process consists of heating the material two to six times and progressively changing its shape by forging until it finally is molded to the contour required by the drawing.

969,"1820 S Grove Avenue | Ontario CA  91761 We Offer Customized Aluminum Alloy and Zinc Alloy Castings Get Custom Die Casting Services Being in business for over 25 years has given us the experience we need to know our clientele, polish our in-house processes, and produce high-grade metal die castings that adhere to industry standards.  We offer custom die casting services with zinc for clients looking to lower their production costs for high-quality finishes. You may also opt for brass or chrome-plated finishes if you think style and durability are what’s most important. We Use Computer Numerical Control Machining During our years in business, we have turned to Computer Numerical Control or CNC machining, a process where pre-programmed computer software dictates the movement of machinery. This method makes it easier for us to produce the metal castings and parts needed by our clients to support their operations and supply chains. The Value of CNC Machining CNC machining helps us churn out high-quality and consistent metal parts, which increases our work efficiencies while also decreasing waste. This technology also dramatically reduces the margin of error on physical production and saves all sorts of time and effort in a busy fabricating business.  We have state-of-the-art machines ranging from 250 to 800 tons. These specifically made machines work on various processes, from drilling to plasma cutting; they also create intricate patterns and shapes in metal pieces. Hot and Cold Chamber Die Casting Our team also has experience using two proven methods: cold chamber die casting and hot chamber die casting. Although similar in many ways, they differ mainly in their heating processes. The hot chamber requires the metal to be heated in the machine, whereas the cold chamber requires the metal to be heated in a separate furnace before transferring it to the casting machine.  In hot chamber casting, the raw materials are heated by the furnace. A plunger then forces the metals through a gooseneck line into the die cavity of the mold. The moving half of the mold retracts from the fixed half, while the finished product is removed from the mold by the ejector pins. The mold halves are then made ready for the next batch of molten metal to be injected.  For cold chamber die casting, the raw material is poured from a ladle into the cold chamber. A plunger advances to push the liquid metal into the die cavity. The fixed half remains in place while the moving half of the cavity retracts. Ejector pins in the moving half remove the finished product, and the mold halves are cleaned and made ready for the next production round. Metalworking Processes Aside from CNC machining, we provide a full range of turnkey fabricating solutions. Our team has the equipment and tools required to easily accommodate such processes, which include deburring or sanding. We also specialize in completing the entire lifecycle of metal fabrication projects, from the initial build to any required finishing processes. Secondary Processes Our team completes some of the secondary processes to ensure high-quality products, including vibratory deburring, shot blasting, sanding, ball burnishing, impregnating, polishing, powder and wet painting, anodizing, and plating. We also offer complete engineering and tooling support utilizing the latest 3D CAD design software. Adherence to Quality Standards We are also known for our complex die casting solutions that adhere to the standards set by the North American Die Casting Association. By strictly following these standards, clients can rest assured that we are a trusted business partner in the manufacturing industry. Our team can provide the customized results you seek for whatever business processes you need to complete.

974,"(216) 231-2600 (800) 935-2601 9503 Woodland AvenueCleveland, Ohio 44104 COMPANY Since 1962, family-owned Forge Products Corporation has produced premium open die forgings for industrial customers across America and around the world. Located near major freeways, airports, rail yards and the Port of Cleveland, Ohio, the company employs a talented crew of metalworkers cross-trained and focused on quality with an average tenure of 20 years. HISTORY Charles (Chuck) Thayer shares the same name as his father, but as a child he believed the two had little in common. During a childhood visit to the Cleveland, Ohio forge shop where his father worked, he said, “I remember thinking, this is one place you’ll never catch me.” The memory often makes him laugh: Mr. Thayer is now President of Forge Products Corporation, the company he and his father started in 1962. Initially focused on the statewide need for machine tools, Forge Products grew steadily over the years, successfully entering new national and international markets to serve diverse industries. The growth led to a series of four moves, each representing another investment in the city of Cleveland. Located at 9503 Woodland Avenue since 1977, the company built a new, two-story office addition in 2012. Expansive upgrades in equipment and quality improvement have resulted in a core of loyal customers who have stayed with the company for a generation or longer. Family-owned through three generations, today, Forge Products features two generations of the Thayer family on staff. And it’s not unusual to find an employee on the shop floor with 25 years tenure at the plant or more. The company marked its 50th anniversary in 2012. QUALITY In addition to a comprehensive Quality Assurance Program that meets or exceeds MIL-S-45208A and MIL-I-45662A standards, Forge Products works exclusively with approved suppliers for testing and heat treating.

The example to the right shows that with machining a 98.14 lb block of raw material is required.  With the forging, only 24.03 lbs of raw material are required. Improved Strength Characteristics The forging process can produce a piece that is stronger than an equivalent cast or machined part. As the metal is shaped during the forging process, its internal grain (illustrated below) flows to follow the shape of the part. As a result, the grain is continuous throughout the part, giving rise to a piece with improved strength characteristics.

987," Proudly serving the industry for 50 Years  Engineering Fabricators was established in December 1963 by Gilbert Skellern and Karel Bloom. They bought its present factory site at 18 Taaibos Street, Powerville in Vereeniging. The company put up a structural steel building and even before completion, started production. Production started with manufacturing of the design and erection of factory buildings. Karel Bloom passed away in 1967 and Gilbert's son, Geoffrey Skellern was appointed director of the company. The company did some heavy steel construction such as components for the mechanism controlling the flow of water from dams in Pongola, Sand River, Vaal-Hartz and Bloemhof. They also manufactured cranes for the Durban docks, tar storage tanks for Iscor. Pressure vessels have also been manufactured to the exacting standards required by the petro-chemical and fertilizer industry. Another area was the manufacturing of steel reels, bobbins and drums for wirerope and cable manufacturers. Engineering Fabricators has also specialised in the manufacturing of brick-making equipment under licence of a world repute German firm in kiln construction. In 1967 the company manufactured the 750ft span of the new bridge over the Vaal             River at Orkney. They also manufacture coco-pans for the gold mines and collieries             and made drums for rope reeling hoists installed in various mine heads. In 1986 Gilbert Skellern passed away. Geoffrey took over as managing director             and Gilbert's grandson, Michael Skellern, the son of Geoffrey Skellern joined Engineering             Fabricators' work force in the same year.             Shortly after that, the company decided to also become a stockist of heat exchanger             tubing, flanges, fittings and piping in carbon steel. This proved to be a successful             addition to the business and eventually was expanded to stainless steel.             Eventually, the manufacturing side of the business was closed down completely             and today, Engineering Fabricators contribute to a major part of the industry by             supplying heat exchanger tubing, flanges, fittings, piping in carbon and stainless             steels. Geoffrey Skellern passed away in 2012 and his son Michael Skellern, who was             trained for years by an exceptional businessman, took over the business.

990,"A Women’s Health Company Case Study Background In September 2014, Amato and Partners began an IR program for a private VC-backed women’s health company through a reverse merger, private placement, up-listing, and growth stage capital raises. Around this time, Amato also began to develop research interest and coverage on the company. Capital Markets Visibility As the company was listed in the OTC, our primary objective was to provide aftermarket support to increase the trading/liquidity of the stock. This was accomplished in part by setting up one-on-one meetings with retail brokers and individual investors to increase awareness of the company’s story in the investment community. Another key component of gaining visibility was securing invitations for the company’s management to present at industry conferences in order to create awareness among retail and institutional investors. We coordinated non-deal roadshows with high net worth investors, family offices and small institutions interested in the company’s technology. To enhance the company’s profile, we created collateral materials, including an investor presentation deck and a corporate fact sheet, and provided press release development and distribution to our database of members of the Wall Street community. Early Funding Amato and Partners helped advise the company on an investment banking syndicate for two private placements with boutique banks of $12 million and $6 million. These capital raises were able to add institutional investors to supplement the existing VC funding. The capital raised was used to help fund clinical studies of the company’s device for the FDA and commercialization in OUS markets. Gaining sell-side research is an essential element of any strong investor relations program. Through our extensive contacts in the capital markets, we were able to gain sell-side research for the company. This was an important step in providing visibility for the company to both institutional and retail investors. Up-listing Amato and Partners advised the company on a strategy to up-list to a senior exchange.  Utilizing our contacts, we introduced the company to both senior exchanges, NYSEMKT and NASDAQCM. In preparation for an up-listing, we advised the company on the appropriate size for a reverse stock split in order to retain enough shares in the public float. We helped introduce the company to additional investment banks which were able to complete a $15.5 million oversubscribed underwritten offering in conjunction with the up-listing to the Nasdaq.  The company also gained additional research coverage, with two new analysts initiating coverage. Growth Capital – Commercialization and Clinical Studies Continuing our strategic IR approach, we introduced the company to larger, higher profile investment banks to cultivate interest.  With two, tier 2 investment banks, the company completed a $31.7 million straight equity raise, with no warrants. This capital raise brought in quality retail ownership and further institutional ownership. In the beginning of 2018, this syndication of banks we had helped put together completed an additional $30 million equity raise. Summary Through our full range of IR services, we took the company from zero trading volume to over 500,000/shares a day. To date, there are 8 well respected analysts that cover the company. We continue to coordinate sponsored Non-Deal roadshows for retail and institutional investors as part of our capital markets visibility program. We continue to execute our IR program as it relates to continued capital markets exposure. Download Case Study: A Women’s Health Company ©2019 Amato and Partners,LLC. All rights reserved. ",3699,556
990,"A Pharmaceutical Oncology Company Case Study Background Amato and Partners, with years of experience in the capital markets, advised a client through a turbulent early stage, and positioned it for growth. A pharmaceutical company with a clinical-stage cancer drug, the company went public through a reverse merger in March of 2013. The company raised $10.5 million by selling a unit consisting of 1 common share and 1 warrant. Shortly after the transaction, the broker/dealer who underwrote the deal went out of business. The stock price was approximately $1.70 per share and daily volume was less than 10,000 shares. Capital Markets Visibility A newly public company with low trading volume, our primary objective was to increase the trading/liquidity of the stock. We accomplished this goal by setting up meetings with retail brokers and individual investors, as well as coordinating nationwide non-deal roadshows with family offices and special situation funds. We were able to secure invitations for company management to present at non-paid industry conferences, increasing visibility among retail and institutional investors and analysts, who had the opportunity to meet with management and hear the company story. The start of sell-side research coverage to date has been an objective we achieved for our client. We continue to be proactive in cultivating relationships with both buy- and sell-side analysts; this includes setting up one-on-one meetings, conference calls and ongoing communication of the company’s progress. Amato and Partners also created collateral materials geared toward the public markets; this included an investor presentation deck and a corporate fact sheet, as well as the investor relations section of the company website. As part of our continuing communication, we field investor inquiries and disseminate company news to our client-specific database of investors. Coordinating Broker/Dealer Sponsorship As with any reverse-merger company, trading volume and liquidity is a challenge in the early stages. For this client, it was exacerbated by the closing of the underwriting broker/dealer. Amato and Partners – through its extensive network in the investment banking community – was able to help secure a new broker/dealer relationship that enabled the company’s original investing shareholders to shift their position to the new broker/dealer. Capital Structure Approach The company had warrants as part of its original offering, creating a derivative liability on their balance sheet and a barrier to up-listing to a senior exchange. In the summer of 2014 the company executed a warrant tender offer. The company was able to decrease the derivative liability and raise $2.4 million in non-dilutive capital. We advised the company on the strategic effects the tender offer would have on the capital markets. Current Status We continue to raise the visibility and profile of the company and help them achieve future IR milestones. The company’s current market cap is approximately $30 million, and over 35,000 of its shares are traded daily. Download Case Study: Pharmaceutical Oncology ©2019 Amato and Partners,LLC.

1025,"WE MAKE IT HAPPEN HISTORY In 1994, the Wolny Family sold everything they owned to buy one die cast machine and rented a small shop about the size of a garage. They believed that they could vastly improve the quality, price and service that was offered at the time by the aluminum die casting industry. The Wolny family grew the business by accepting the challenging projects that other die-casters didn’t want. The willingness to go above and beyond for customers and help solve complex problems has been a foundational pillar which has allowed Dart Casting to grow from that one die casting machine to 17 today. Dart Casting continues into the future as a private business using the same core beliefs and focus that it started with almost 30 years ago.

Without them, the connection of lines and plant equipment such as chillers, filters, control valves and backflow preventers are a nightmare – especially if ready access is unavailable to any component for installation or maintenance. An easier way of fitting flanged equipment is always welcome. The CTS Copper Companion Flange, a fully floating flange, is such a logical development in copper tube installation that it is hard to believe that no one has thought of it before. The concept is very simple.  Instead of having to install a brass companion flange that requires careful alignment of bolt holes during brazing, the CTS Copper Companion Flange uses a copper fitting brazed/soldered directly to the copper tube, backed by a fully floating powder coated steel flange fitted with a neoprene insulator.  The integral insulator allows the CTS flange to offer 100% protection against electrolysis. The system has many advantages: CTS Flanges Why Choose CTS Flange Contact CTS Canada Sitemap © 2023CTS Flange Canada. All Rights Reserved.Site byTangent ",1202,187

Serving multiple markets including Aerospace, Military, Defense, Automobile, Semiconductor, Nuclear and Space Manufacturing. Our experience team of metallurgists and technicians delivers quality and consistency to your forging requirements. ​ Technology Of all structural metals and alloys, the aluminum alloys are the most readily forged to precise intricate shapes.  Hydraulic presses often are preferred for aluminum because they are most versatile and slow forging speeds are of little concern, compared to what would be true for steel forgings.  Hand forgings are commonly produced in simple shapes such as squares, rectangles, biscuits and multi-faced rounds.  Pre-formed Shapes and Special Shapes Superior can also forge pre-formed shapes and special shapes depending on your order.  Standard-shape hand forgings can be described without the aid of a drawing. A critical factor in designing small forgings is the grain-flow patterns.  The predominant direction of grain flow is normally longitudinal in squares, rectangles, and multi-faced rounds. In biscuits, the predominant grain flow is usually radial. ©2023 Superior Handforge Albert Industries Ltd.

1056,"PROJECTS This wind park is located in Sault St Marie, Ontario, Canada. We were first hired to support Wanzek Construction with their first Canadian project by providing Ontario local content labourers who understood the terrain and turbine specifications. Throughout the first phase (12 turbines) of the project our scope continued to grow as the general contractor relied on Surespan to work through tough conditions. Eventually our specialized LG 1750 crane was mobilized to site and replaced the crawler crane that was being used until that point. Given the speed and efficiency of our teams on site, Wanzek awarded us the second phase (24 turbines) lump sum and we finished on time and on budget. In total, we installed 36 GE 1.78MW turbines on 100 meter towers in some of the most difficult terrain and weather in Northern Ontario. ",837,138
1056,"PROJECTS The Grey Highlands wind project was located in McIntyre, Ontario and owned by Capstone Infrastructure. The project consisted of 5 Senvion MM92 wind turbines, with a rated capacity of 2.0 MW. The construction of the project began in September 2015 and completed in December 2015. Erection of the turbines was completed by Surespan’s LG1750 (“The Bean”). Surespan was contracted by CER Inc. to complete the erection and all internal finishing of the turbines. Surespan went on to complete an additional four projects for Capstone Infrastructure and CER Inc. The final phase of the contract was completed in February 2017. Over the course of the five projects, Surespan completed offloading, erection and all in-tower work of 32 MM92 Senvion Turbines. ",758,120
1056,"PROJECTS The site owner/developer is a partnership between Samsung Renewable Energy, Inc. & Pattern Energy Group LP. RES Canada was selected to serve as the general contractor to oversee project management of all construction activities. South Kent Wind is the tenth renewable energy project built by RES Canada. The main erection crane for the towers was the “Vivian”, one of Surespan Wind’s new LG1750. We also used many RT and AT cranes from various suppliers. There was an average of 300 Surespan workers on-site throughout project construction beginning in July and approximately 500 workers during peak construction periods. The weather in June was so extreme with heavy rains and the resulting mud, which meant that rain mats were required to support the cranes and protect the ground. Over the winter months temperatures fell to 40 below and worse. We had to start reducing capacities after about 34 below and motors and hydraulics were our biggest challenges. Our equipment has winter backup systems with pre-heaters etc. so that we can carry on and be as productive as possible during the cold months. High winds blowing the snow in the fields would shut down even snowplows. Lack of visibility would also shut us down. But once the wind stops we come in and dig ourselves out and carry on working again. ",1315,219

1056,"PROJECTS For the Summerhaven project we provided Technical Field Advisors to support Siemens for the installation of 58 turbines with total generation capacity of of 128.82 MW. Development on the Summerhaven Wind Energy Centre began in 2006 by NextEra Energy Canada.  The wind farm is located in Haldimand County, Ontario. At the maximum generating capacity, the Summerhaven Wind Energy Centre produces enough energy for approximately 32,000 homes. Siemens, as the manufacturer of the turbines on this project, was responsible for having a representative on site who supervised the contractor as they installed the turbines to ensure correct installation and to identify any potential issues. Siemens didn’t have enough of these Technical Field Advisors so they hired Surespan due to our technicians’ experience with Siemens turbines.  We had half a dozen advisors onsite for the length of the project as representatives of Siemens. Challenges Overcome: The Summerhaven site was in very good shape and there was no wind. Precautions needed to be taken to ensure safety during the frequent lightning on this project.

The 1.5 megawatt wind turbine which stands at the top of Grouse Mountain, weighs more than 250 tonnes and rises 65 metres from its base to the top of the tower. Construction of the turbine was a collaboration between Grouse Mountain and Italy’s Leitwind Technology. It is the world’s first and only wind turbine that allows visitors to stand in a clear glass viewPOD at the top of the tower, three metres from its massive, rotating blades. Surespan’s part of the project began in late September of 2009. It took longer to get the crane up and down the mountain than it did to erect the turbine. Transportation was provided by Surespan’s off highway lowbed and we used our LR1280 with 190’main boom and 90′ lugging jib which was reduced to 80′ for the generator lift. Challenges Overcome: The unique aspects of this project included mobilizing to the peak of Grouse Mountain up a winding narrow old mountain road. Staging by the Grouse Mountain Grizzly Bear Den and very limited room at site. The boom was assembled in the air because of a huge dip in the surrounding area. There wasn’t nearly enough room to assemble the 300t crane with the boom length required. ",1297,226
1056,"PROJECTS Working together with Samsung C&T we erected a wind farm in Haldimand County which generates approximately 150 MW of wind power. The project consisted of building 67 100-metre Siemens turbines along municipal roads in an area south of Hamilton, Ontario. The project was around 37 km from end to end. The LR 1600 was the secondary crane, completing approximately 1/3 of the work, alongside of the primary LG1750. The project began in March 2014 and completed in June of 2014. Challenges Overcome: We were able to help create positive teamwork with other sub-contractors involved in the project and bring the group together to hit the required marks for the general contractor. Later in the project we had to run the LG 1750 crane 24 hours a day with two full crews in order to meet deadlines. With this operation, we were able to bring up almost one turbine per day. Our LG 1750 crane is able to work non-stop because it’s thoroughly maintained so that it’s perfectly reliable, which eliminates the need to spend any time on repairs during projects. Due to our years of experience, we have grown in our capacity to be more creative with how to complete projects. When planning, we bring multiple strategies to our clients, in order to improve overall efficiency. Our ability to improvise and make adjustments based on circumstances helped us overcome the challenges presented in this project. ",1401,236

1086,"About Hammond & Irving, Inc. Hammond & Irving, Inc.was founded by Charles Hammond and Robert Irving in 1919. The combination of this expert hammersman and owner of a mill supply business allowed H&I to immediately supply quality forged products to a strong local customer base. H&I broke from the tradition of serving only local needs in the early 1920s. As the company continued to expand, larger capacity hammers were acquired to facilitate our entrance into new markets. This expansion from a few small steam hammers to nine hammers that covered a wide range of sizes and shapes ensured the company continued success during the depression. H&I invested in a unique piece of equipment in the late 60s which revolutionized its manufacturing process. The original ring roller gave H&I the advantage of producing rings at a faster speed, and was able to change measurements (set-up) in a matter of minutes rather than what previously took hours or even days. During the 70s and 80s two hydraulic presses were acquired to replace our large hammers. However, we still maintain ""small"" hammer equipment and are capable of producing the finest hammered product available in the market. In the spring of 1999 H&I continued its investment into the future through the purchase of a Wagner 63/63 RAW ring roller and support equipment. Many pieces of equipment throughout the facility were upgraded, and product flow was greatly improved. This state-of-the art piece of equipment allows H&I to manufacture a superior rolled ring with greater accuracy and improved consistency. For the last several years H&I has remained on the path of continuous improvement by investing in the company. Much of our manufacturing equipment has been upgraded with improved controls. New equipment has been added to the facility. Our employees have been continuously trained and we are registered to the latest standards of the ISO 9001 Standard. In 2009 the company completed a major addition to the heat treat and shipping departments. This project allows us to meet the delivery requirements of our customers. ",2085,337

1123,"Sintering  Sinteringis the process of using heat to turn powdered substances into solids without actually melting the material.  Benefits of sintered powder metallurgy (PM): About Compax Sintering: Sintering allows production of parts without melting and liquid casting processes, i.e., dealing with only powder or fine sand.  The compacted part is placed on a mesh belt or a tray and slowly moves through a furnace with a controlled atmosphere and temperature. The parts are heated below the melting point of the metals. The compacted particles of the part are changed from a mechanical bond between the particles into a metallurgical bond between the particles.   Compax has higher sintering capabilities than most of its competitors. A higher sintering temperature creates enhanced mechanical properties and significantly improves stainless steel materials. COMPAX INC. Offers: We offer belt, pusher, batch, sinter heat treat, draw (temper) furnaces, blackening, passivation and annealing.

1128,"The CT Scan Gets Spooky Home»The CT Scan Gets Spooky Have you ever seen the inside of a pumpkin? Of course, you have! Every Halloween people slice open pumpkins and remove the innards which creates a perfect viewing angle for which to see inside. But, what if I told you it was possible to look inside a pumpkin without having to cut into it? No, this is not some sort of black magic, but the power of science! With the advancement in technology, this very thing has become a reality. That technology is called CT Scanning. Non-destructive CT scanning has a number of different applications. Here at Castem, the applications we use the most are dimensional inspection, defect analysis, reverse engineering, and archiving. Today’s scan showcases all these except dimensional inspection. Using our Nikon MCT225 machine, we’ve taken a dive into everyone’s favorite (or overdone) squash, as well as a traditional gourd. Thanks to the machine’s micro-focus high resolution, we have explored the internal geometries of the spooky veggie down to microns without even touching it. The scanner takes thousands of X-ray images in 360 degrees around the object and reconstructs them into a full 3D image. To see what we mean, take a look below. This is an example of archiving, as the original pumpkin has long since rotted away, but it remains here, in our computer drives. (Click or tap on the images for greater detail)  Using this non-destructive process, you can take a look inside without the need to cut it open. Below, you can see a cross-sectional image anywhere desired on the X, Y, and Z axes within the object. To those of you who have carved a pumpkin before – does this look familiar to you? One of the biggest strengths of CT Scanning is that you can actually use the data from the scan to extract specific internal parts of the object. Here we’ve isolated two seeds from the gourd and highlighted them. Actually, many seeds. If you’re ever trying to play those guessing games where you need to estimate how many candies or objects are in a jar, then CT scanning is the solution for you! Take a guess of how many are in the gourd, and we’ll tell you at the end of the article if you were right.   In fact, the detail is so great we can actually 3D print one of these seeds without ever looking at it. As you might expect, each seed is only about 10 millimeters long, or 3/8ths of an inch for Americans. This may be a slightly unconventional use-case, but it’s a good example of reverse engineering, the second of our CT uses.  Or the air pockets inside the pumpkin flesh. Looking at air pockets in this way is actually akin to looking for voids or other internal defects in molds and other metal parts.  And while this whole post may not be the most useful to you readers at home, I hope this has captured your interest inscanning a rotting pumpkin to see what rot looks like on the insidethe possibilities of CT scanning. Well, feeling spooky yet? Who knew squash hid so many secrets? Maybe now you want to make a mask out of squash innards, just wrinkly seeds, and fibers. It’s sure to freak someone out. Tune in next time for something new. P.S. There were 418 seeds. October 2021 Important links We use cookies to optimize our website and our service. ",3260,580

Ferro-TicÂ®Steel-Bonded Titanium Carbide Materials ProvideWear Resistance in Severe Operating Conditions Ferro-TiCÂ®: A family of steel or alloy-bonded carbides.  Extremely hard titanium carbide grains are uniformly distributed through a hardenable metal matrix.  The result is a unique combination of high wear resistance, with heat or corrosion resistance,  and readily machinable using conventional techniques. Industrial Applications for Ferro-TicÂ® Ferro-TiCÂ® Grade Selection Why Titanium Carbide? Titanium Carbideoutlasts conventional tool steels by a factor of 10, while at the same time providing much better fracture toughness than cemented Tungsten Carbide.  In an annealed state, these unique materials are machinable by conventional machining methods, such as turning, milling and drilling.  In heat-treated state, they can achieve hardness of HRC 69.

1135,"Design, Engineer and Manufacture Custom Titanium Screws, Cutting Blades and Industrial Knives Custom Titanium Parts and Components -High Wear Resistance and Lightweight Superhard rounded titanium carbide grains impart high wear resistance and outstanding lubricity. These smooth, rounded grains are held firmly in place by steel or alloy matrix binders; each specically formulated to provide such properties as toughness, resistance to heat, corrosion or other hostile environments. The Tic grains provide light weight, size stability and high hardness. Ferro-TiCÂ® is less brittle and one half the weight of cemented tungsten carbide. Ultra-hard titanium carbide micrograins (3200 Vickers vs. 2400 for tungsten carbide) are uniformly distributed throughout a hardenable matrix alloy. A two-fold complementary effect is achieved whereby the hard, round titanium carbide grains protect the matrix while the specially formulated matrix securely grips the self-lubricating titanium carbide micrograins. The result: greatly improved life, even when used with highly abrasive materials.  Custom Titanium Cutting Blades & Industrial Knives - Ferro-Tic Keeps Cutting Edges Keen Cutting demands a sharp, keen edge for blanking punches, shear knives, rotating slitters, pelletizer knives or bed knives. The very fine, rounded, slippery titanium carbide grains nestled in a tough metal matrix resist dulling and chipping. Ferro-TiCÂ® maintains a sharp cutting edge through millions of cycles. Custom Titanium Carbide Industrial Punches, Tools and Dies Titanium Carbide Parts Overcome Galling and Pick-up Pick-up and galling are frequent problems when metals rub against each other at high speeds or under heavy pressure. Exposing the Ferro-TiCÂ® titanium carbide micrograins at the working surface leaves them in relief and, in effect, minimizes metal-to-metal contact. Their smooth, rounded structure offers an extremely slippery and non-abrasive surface for contact. When working with such metals as high-nickel alloys or tough stainless steel, the Ferro-TiCÂ® composite produces scratch-free parts throughout long production runs. For critical moving parts, even under conditions of poor lubrication, Ferro-TiCÂ® operates with a low coefficient of friction and extended part life. Custom Ferro-TicÂ® Parts Withstand Abrasive Impact Ferro-TiCÂ® alloys offer an impressive compressive strength of up to 520,000 p.s.i. to easily withstand high compressive loading without deformations. With an elastic modulus of 40-44 million p.s.i., about half that of cemented tungsten carbide, Ferro-TiCÂ® can take more deflection under stress and transfer more of the applied load to a stronger back-up member. Ferro-TiCÂ® WORKS FOR YOU! Custom Manufactured Carbide Metal Wear Parts for Aerospace, Hydraulic Components and High Stress Industrial Applications As technological advances bring about ever higher production speeds and greater stresses, parts subjected to wear that retain their integrity for extended periods of time become more essential. Ferro-TiCÂ® steel-bonded carbides are meeting that demand. As simple wear parts, curns or cam followers of Ferro-TiCÂ® help maintain machinery precision over years of use. Serrated weld wire feed rolls maintain their sharpness, insuring trouble-free continuous operation. Industrial Applications for Ferro-TicÂ® Parts In the aerospace industry, critical hydraulic components or jet fuel pump parts must maintain very close tolerances, even when operating within contaminated fluids. Ferro-TiCÂ® is the answer; its machinability and thermal stability are essential for the intricate shapes required. Gas bearings for inertial guidance systems use Ferro-TiCÂ® for both the rotors and shafts. It is also used in high speed dental drills. Both take advantage of its light weight, its stiffness and its inherent lubricity, even when bearing against itself. For valve seats, stems or rtating face seals, the corrosion resistance of CS-40 is an important factor. Component parts in disc drives or data recording devices must be non-magnetic and wear resistance to ensure long life. Grade HT-6A meets these requirements. Ferro-TiCÂ® has excellent vibration dampening characteristics, a requisite for grinding wheel spindles, boring bars and tool holders. Depths of cut can be increased. Tool chatter is reduced which results in less noise, better dimensional control and improved surface finish.  Have questions about our Applications?

1142,"Magnetic Materials Rare Earth Magnets  High Performance Magnets Alnico Magnets - High Performance The most common magnetic materials in use today are alnico, ceramic (hard ferrites), samarium cobalt, and neodymium.  Each are made up of different elements used for different applications. Short Timeline of Modern Permanent Magnets A big step in the evolution of the permanent magnet materials used today came in the 1930’s with the development of Alnico magnets. In 1931, T. Mishima discovered that an alloy of iron, nickel, aluminum had a much higher coercivity than the best steel magnets of the time. Further research created alnico, a term referring to a series of permanent magnet alloys which in addition to iron are composed primarily of aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co). Various alnico grades with differing magnetic properties can be achieved by modifying the chemistry and manufacturing process. Today’s composition of alnico alloys is typically 8–12% Al, 15–26% Ni, 5–24% Co, up to 6% Cu, up to 1% Ti, with the balance being Fe. In addition to varying the alloy composition, specialized casting techniques can be used to achieve unique crystalline grain orientation. Examples of this are alnico 5-7 and 9. Once magnetized, Alnico magnets have between 5 and 17 times the magnetic force of magnetite or lodestone, a naturally occurring magnet which can attract iron. Alnico magnets have the benefit of having the lowest temperature coefficient, or temperature stability of all of the permanent magnet materials. Plus, they can be calibrated and have high residual induction.Before the development of rare earth magnets in the 1970’s, alnico was the strongest type of permanent magnet. Since that time, many applications using alnico have replaced it with less expensive or more powerful types of magnets. However, the fact that alnico can be used in very high temperatures (up to 930°F or 500°C) make them indispensable in certain applications. Alnico magnets are also ideal for corrosive applications and are commonly used for various types of sensors. They are stronger than ceramic magnets, but not as strong as rare-earth magnets. Manufacturing Processes: Alnico magnets are manufactured either by casting or sintering: Most alnico produced is anisotropic, meaning that the magnetic direction of the grains is oriented in one direction.  This orientation is achieved via heat treatment after casting or sintering.  The process involves heating the cast or sintered part above its Curie temperature and then cooling it at a controlled rate in the presence of a strong directional magnetic field.  Final shaping of the alnico materials is achieved by abrasive grinding and cutting where close tolerances are required. Properties: Hard Ferrites Ceramic magnets, like the ones used in refrigerator magnets and elementary-school science experiments, contain iron oxide in a ceramic composite.  Most ceramic magnets, sometimes known as ferrite magnets, aren’t particularly strong. Ceramic permanent magnets are made from finely powdered barium ferrite or strontium ferrite formed under heat and pressure.  Their magnetic strength is enhanced by aligning the powder particles with a strong magnetic field during forming.  Ceramic magnets are somewhat comparable to alnico magnets in terms of magnetic force and have the advantage of being able to be pressed into various shapes without significant machining.  However, hard ferrites are not magnetically stable at higher temperatures.  They are typically used in magnets where price is a primary driver, rather than size or mass. Advantages: Disadvantages: Samarium Cobalt Magnets In the 1970s, researchers developed permanent magnets made from powdered samarium cobalt fused under heat.  Samarium cobalt magnets can be made to produce magnetic fields 50 times stronger than magnetite.  Samarium cobalt magnets can operate in higher temperatures, but cannot be calibrated. Samarium cobalt magnets are made mostly from samarium and cobalt, with small amounts of other elements such as iron, copper, zirconium and hafnium.  The majority of the material is cobalt.  They are typically used in higher temperature applications where the strength of rare earth magnets is still needed.  They have a higher Curie temperature than NdFeB, but are also more expensive to manufacture. Neodymium Iron Boron Magnets The newest permanent magnet material was developed in the 1980s using powdered neodymium iron boron (NdFeB).  This type of magnetic material produces magnetic forces almost 75 times stronger than magnetite.  These are the most powerful permanent magnets commercially available today. Neodymium magnets are made up of neodymium, iron and boron, with the majority being iron.  They are the strongest type of permanent magnet available.  While they have the highest magnetic field strength, they have a lower Curie temperature and are more vulnerable to oxidation than samarium cobalt magnets.  Corrosion causes the material to crumble into a powder, losing their magnetic properties. Bonded or Flexible Permanent Magnets Bonded or flexible permanent magnets are made from mixing magnetic materials with a rubber or plastic matrix.  Nearly any magnet material can be used to create a bonded magnet.  The most common bonded materials incorporate either hard ferrites or NdFeB.  For instance, powdered barium ferrite or strontium ferrite can be mixed in a binding material such as rubber or a flexible plastic like polyvinyl chloride, to form a bonded magnet material.  The magnetic performance of the bonded magnet can be impacted by the concentration level of magnet material to binder. Alnico magnets have the benefit of having the lowest temperature coefficient, or temperature stability, of all of the permanent magnet materials.

1181,"What Are Lifting Magnets Made Of? What kinds of materials are used in making magnets? How do we select the magnets that power lifting magnets such as our Magnetic SpecialtiesModel 1037? It takes a lot more power to lift 2,500 pounds of steel plate than can be found in a steel or iron compass needle, that’s for sure. Magnetic materials used these days fall into four groups: Alnico, Ceramic (Ferrite), Samarium-Cobalt, and Neodymium. Each has its own characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. Alnicomagnets are made from iron alloyed primarily with aluminum, nickel, and cobalt, thus the name, though they can also include copper or titanium, and these magnets have been around since the 1930s.While not the strongest magnets when compared to rare earth magnets, they have the highest range of operating temperatures. As temperature increases, magnets begin to lose strength, and when the temperature reaches theCurie temperaturefor that magnetic material, they lose all magnetization and become useless as magnets until remagnetized. The Curie temperatures for Alnico magnets are the highest, in the range of 800° C and with a maximum normal operating temperature in the range of 500° C. Depending on the exact Alnico alloy, Alnico magnets can be isotropic, able to be magnetized in any direction, while others are anositropic, having a preferred direction of magnetization. They are less resistant to corrosion than the rare earth magnets, but not so much as the ferrites. Though the oldest of the four categories of magnets listed above, their combination of strength and thermal characteristics makes them still relevant today, and they are used in such areas as the manufacture of guitar pickups, electric motors, microphones, sensors, and loudspeakers. Ceramicmagnets (Ferritemagnets) were also originally developed in the 1930s, with technological advances increasing their magnetic strength to the levels we see today. They are made from iron (III) oxide mixed with other elements such as strontium, barium, manganese, nickel, or zinc, and are strong, very resistant to corrosion, retain their magnetism very well, and economical of cost. This combination of factors makes ceramic magnets the magnet of choice for applications such ourModel 1057lifting magnet, able to lift up to 2500 pounds of steel plate, as well as for magnetic sign capping with ourMagna Caps. Unusually compared to other ferromagnetic materials, ferrite magnets are not conductors of electricity. They have a good operating temperature range, though with a Curie temperature in the range of 450° C not to the level of Alnico magnets. Due to the combination of cost and power, ceramic magnets see wide applications industrially in lifting and separating, and because of their lack of electrical conductivity, find use in transformers and even electromagnets to control eddy current losses. The core memory of early computers was made with ferrite cores, and ferrite particles and powder are even used in magnetic recording tape as well as in radar-absorbing stealth technology. Neodymiummagnets are the magnets people usually mean when they speak of rare earth magnets, though there are actually 17 rare earth elements, and samarium-cobalt magnets are also rare earth magnets. They have the highest strength for their size, of all the types of magnets you can buy today, which makes them the choice when power is the only consideration, but they have significant disadvantages as well. They were discovered in the 1980s independently by General Motors and by Sumitomo Special Metals and are available in several grades of strength, from N28 to N52 (the strongest). All are anisotropic, strongly having a preferred direction of magnetization and difficult to magnetize in other directions. They tend to be vulnerable to corrosion and are thus often covered with a protective coat. Neodymium magnets are very costly, and not generally suitable for high-temperature applications due to their lowish Curie temperatures, in the 300-400° C range. Even with these disadvantages however they find wide usage, in applications from electric motors and computer hard drives to magnetic bearings and loudspeakers. Samarium-Cobaltmagnets are our final class of magnets, and they, like neodymium magnets, belong to the category of rare earth magnets. Like neodymium magnets they are quite strong, though not quite so much so as the neodymium. When you add in the fact that they are also brittle, like neodymium magnets, but are even more costly, you might think that there is no reason for using them, but they do have one large advantage over neodymium, and that is the operating range of temperatures, with Curie temperatures in the range of 700-800° C, about twice as high as for neodymium. AtMagnetic Specialties, we have dealt with all of these from the ceramic magnets utilized in ourModel 1037, 1037jr,and otherlifting magnets, to custom-designed neodymium applications.

In 1983, Halfmoon founder Beth McTavish was captivated by yogis practicing at the edge of the Ganges River, in Varanasi, India. She was mesmerized by their intent, their focus, and the stillness of yoga in the midst of noise, chaos, and colour. When she returned home her own Iyengar practice began. In 1989, Beth united her love for yoga with her experience in manufacturing. A red seat belt became a yoga strap and rolls of cotton batting became sturdy handcrafted bolsters. Halfmoon Yoga Products had begun. Since the start, Halfmoon has been inspired by the values of yoga: non-violence, truthfulness, abstention from wrongdoing, compassion and kindness. Almost 30 years since its inception, the same values continue to inspire Halfmoon, along with its sister company, B Yoga. Together, Halfmoon and B Yoga continue to offer diverse and enduring yoga and meditation props to yogis across the globe. Â© The Stewart Group 2020 ",3626,547

1191,"Open The Door Products Soft Close Magnetic Catch The ""Quiet Magnetic Catch"" Open The Door Products is the inventor and producer of the innovative soft close magnetic catch. This catch is specifically designed for high-quality inset cabinetry and furniture, but will work well in any situation that you would use a standard magnetic catch. Our magnets are very quiet, soft-closing, and yet easy to open. Incredibly, our two powerful neodymium magnets exert sufficient force to pull in mildly warped doors and prevent future warping. Please take a minute to view our video below. You can't appreciate this unit without seeing it in action. Please seeContact Usfor the best possible way of reaching us!

1191,"Open The Door Products About us The Founder ofOpen The Door Productshas over 50 years of experience in the custom cabinetry industry. We sincerely believe that life is about relationships; the better our relationships, the better our lives. It is our goal to create relationships of the highest integrity with our suppliers, employees, distributors, cabinet shops, and the end users.  Our Purpose Our purpose is to fulfill a 40 plus year need for a better magnetic catch. Most magnetic catches are noisy, hard to open, and cheap-looking on high-quality cabinetry. All other types of latches such as ball catches, roller catches and turn latches require that you push and follow the door until it is completely closed. Spring-loaded hinges were developed to solve this problem, but they fall short of filling all the requirements of inset cabinetry because an adjustable door stop is still needed.  Many “purist” designers prefer the appearance of an exposed “butt-type” hinge, which opens 180 degrees rather than the 110/120 degrees of a concealed euro hinge. Another need in the high-end custom cabinet industry is a way of preventing warped doors. Our catch employs two high-strength, high-grade permanent neodymium magnets with enough force to pull in mildly warped doors. It also stands to reason that if a magnet can pull in warped doors, the constant force will help to prevent most doors from warping in the future. We have even seen our magnets pull in non-warped doors to compensate for improperly installed cabinets that are ""racked"". How valuable is the warped door prevention to you? Consider how much it costs to replace a door. How nearly impossible it is to produce a new door that matches well because it is probably not made from the same batch of wood, possibly made and finished by different people, and will not have the same amount of aging. This benefit alone could nearly offset the difference in the cost of the soft close magnetic catches and you also have the advantage of quiet, soft-closing and easy to open action, which is a great sales advantage for your product.

1191,"Open The Door Products FAQ's At Open the Door Products, we've done our best to create a Website that anticipates and satisfies our customers' needs. With that goal in mind, we've compiled a list of frequently asked questions. If you do not find an answer to your question here, contact us at 518.568.2969 oropenthedoor@frontier.com Where can we buy the products? SeeContactus What wood species are available? Inventoried wood species are maple, cherry, walnut, red oak, white oak, and mahogany. other species are available by special order. Why do you use wooden mounting bases? Die cast metal and plastic-mounting bases are available on the market, however they are too low-profile to work properly on inset cabinetry. The corresponding door magnet is too close to the edge of the door. Another reason is that they do not provide the adjustability that is needed with most cabinetry. A third reason is that a mounting base made of wood that matches the cabinet interior will visually blend in and be less noticeable. These units are designed first for great function and then to blend in with the cabinet interior. What makes these closers so quiet? We use two precisely tuned magnets to draw the door closed in combination with a shock absorber to keep the door from slamming or bouncing open. Additionally, we do not allow the magnets to make contact by separating them with a soft, pyramid-shaped neoprene bumper. What type of magnets are used? The Neodymium, rare earth, magnets are made to our specific ""tuned"" size, strength and grade. They are permanent magnets tested to lose less than 5% of their strength of 10 years. How can your magnets be strong enough to pull in warped doors and still be easy to open? Most magnets are rated by theirholdingforce. To create ease of opening, we do not allow the two magnets to make contact by applying a pyramid-shaped, soft neoprene bumper between them. This also makes them very quiet, but creates the need for fine tuning the strength and grade of the magnets to off-set the resistance of the shock absorber. Can the wood mounting bases be finished to match cabinet interiors? Yes, you can paint over the existing natural finish (after removing the shock), or by ordering unfinished units in maple, cherry, walnut, red oak, white oak, and mahogany. Other wood species are available by special order with longer lead times and a minimum order. Do mounting bases have to be disassembled to finish? Only the shock must be removed because application of finish will likely inhibit it's function. It is important that you do not apply an excessive amount of finish to the inside of the bore for the shock because it may cause the block to split when reinserting the shock. you can paint or varnish over the magnet without affecting it's function. What keeps the magnets in the mounting base and the cabinet door? We use a pin that is pressed through the wood and a hole in the magnet to keep the magnet in the block. Using the pin for mounting makes it possible to reverse the magnet polarity, if necessary. The corresponding door magnet fits tightly into a properly drilled hole, however we know that wood will dry out and this magnet could come loose. To prevent this possibility we use a screw mount door magnet. Refer to theProductssection for a picture. What type of shock absorber do you use and why? We use an Italian-made shock by Salice because they are available in different strengths and the one that we use works best at dampening the drawing force of the magnets and preventing bounce if the door is slammed. Other shocks on the market are self-adjusting, which does not work as well for our particular purpose. How difficult are your catches to install? There is very little difference from installing a standard magnet with a metal plate. there are two screws in the mounting base and one hole to drill in the cabinet door for the magnet to be glued in, The final step is application of the soft, pyramid-shaped bumper, which is self-adhesive. We recommend a placement jig and C-clamp for consistent mounting of the blocks in the cabinet and a drill press with a jig for consistent drilling of door magnet holes for high production efficiency. What happens if my cabinet floor is not flush with the inside edge of my face frame? There will be no problem if the floor is very, nearly flush (i.e.: within 1/32"" to 1/16"") with the inside of the face frame. The problem that can occur is the magnet in the door will become very close to the edge of the door. This may create the need to shim the mounting base or request a higher mounting base made for your situation. What height blocks are kept in stock for quick delivery? The soft-close mounting blocks standard height is 3/4"". These are available in all of our normal wood species. We now stock 7/8"" high blocks in maple, cherry, and walnut. These are used when cabinets are constructed with floors held down from the edge of the face frame so that the floor can be machined into the face frame. Refer to theProductspage to see these blocks. Can we get custom-sized mounting blocks? Yes, in situations such as floors that are not flush with the top edge of the face frame you may need a higher block. These can be produced, but with longer lead times and minimum order quantities. What color door shocks are available? Honey-colored shocks are standard. White shocks are available, if requested only, when ordering unfinished maple blocks. The white shocks are ideal when cabinets are being painted to match light-colored painted interiors. How long does it take for delivery? We maintain a considerable inventory of all items shown in the ""Products"" section. Thus, we will normally ship via FedEx within one day of your order. Large or custom orders may take four to five weeks to produce, so we recommend that you order units when your project is sold rather than wait until the day you need them.

1191,"Open The Door Products About Us About us The founders ofOpen The Door Productshave over 50 years of experience in the custom cabinetry industry. We sincerely believe that life is about relationships; the better our relationships, the better our lives. It is our goal to create relationships of the highest integrity with our suppliers, employees, distributors, cabinet shops, and the end users.  Our Purpose Our purpose is to fulfill a 40 plus year need for a better magnetic catch. Most magnetic catches are noisy, hard to open, and cheap-looking on high-quality cabinetry. All other types of latches such as ball catches, roller catches and turn latches require that you push and follow the door until it is completely closed. Spring-loaded hinges were developed to solve this problem, but they fall short of filling all the requirements of inset cabinetry because an adjustable door stop is still needed. Another need in the high-end custom cabinet industry is a way of preventing warped doors. Our catch employs two high-strength, high-grade permanent neodymium magnets with enough force to pull in mildly warped doors. It also stands to reason that if a magnet can pull in warped doors, the constant force will also help to prevent most doors from futuristically warping. we have even seen our magnets pull in non-warped doors to compensate for improperly installed cabinets that are ""racked"". How valuable is the warped door prevention to you? Consider how much it costs to replace a door and how nearly impossible it is to produce a new door that matches well because it is not made out that same batch of material, possible made and finished by different people, and will not have the same amount of aging. This benefit alone could nearly offset the difference in the cost of the soft close magnetic catches, and you also have the advantage of quiet, soft-closing and easy to open action.

1203,"Capabilities DyCast Specialties Corporationis a full-service die-casting company that produces precision aluminum and zinc castings. We provide a comprehensive range of engineering services, including design ideas, prototypes, tooling, and production, as well as metal machining and finish. We can deliver the highest quality and service to our clients because of our skilled team. High-Pressure Die Casting High-pressure die casting is a process in which it forces molten metal into a mold cavity under high pressure.  The high pressure used in this process allows for a much more detailed and accurate final product. According toEngineering.com, it is applicable for large-scale production and used for metals with high melting points, such as aluminum, brass, and cast iron. The high-pressure die casting process begins with melting the metal in a furnace and then injected into the mold cavity under high pressure. The metal cools and solidifies in the mold, then ejects the part. The high pressure in this process ensures that the metal retains its shape and produces a robust and durable component. Some advantages of high-pressure die casting include: Aluminum Castings Aluminum castingsare a versatile and essential manufacturing component for many industries. Our facility specializes in aluminum die castings, which create complex geometric shapes. We offer small, medium, and large die castings, with parts weighing up to 10 pounds. Our machine sizes range from 600 to 725 tons. We specialize in several different aluminum alloys, such as: In addition, we havetodie-cast machine cells dedicated to high-pressure aluminum die casting. These cells consist of 600 – 725 ton die casting machines, and 600LB/hour 4800LB capacity furnaces, and maintain tight tolerances of +/- 0.0025. Mold longevity can range anywhere from 40,000 shots to 100,000 shots depending on part and mold design complexities. Zinc Castings When it comes to creating complex yet durable metal parts,zinc castingsare in a league of their own.ThoughtCostates that various products have zinc alloys, such as corrosion-resistant marine components and musical instruments. Able to reproduce even the most intricate shapes, zinc castings are applicable for small to medium-sized parts. And thanks to die-cast cells that use high-pressure zinc alloy, these parts are also solid and resistant to wear and tear. Plus, with mold longevity of up to 1,500,000 shots, you can be sure that your zinc castings will be around for the long haul. We specialize in several different zinc alloys, such as: Tooling Construction The quality of your tools has a direct impact on the quality of your work.

1216,"Anodes  A galvanic anode is the main component of a galvanic Cathodic Protection (CP) system used to protect buried or submerged metal structures from corrosion. They are made from a metal alloy with a more ""active"" voltage (more negative electrochemical potential) than the metal of the structure. The difference in potential between the two metals means that the galvanic an ode corrodes, so that the anode material is consumed in preference to the structure. The loss (or sacrifice) of the anode material gives rise to the alternative name of sacrificial anode. Anode Materials There are three main alloys used as galvanic anodes, magnesium, aluminum and zinc. They are all available as blocks, rods, plates or extruded ribbon. Each material has advantages and disadvantages. Aluminum Aluminum anodes have several advantages: they are much lighter in weight, and have a much higher capacity than zinc. Their electrochemical behavior is not considered as reliable as zinc and greater care must be taken in how they are used. When aluminum strikes a rusty surface a large thermite spark may be generated, so its use is restricted in tanks where there may be explosive atmospheres and there is a risk of the anode falling. Read more about ourAluminum Anodes... Zinc Zinc is considered a reliable material but is not suitable for use at higher temperatures as it tends to passivate (it becomes less negative - if this happens, current may cease to flow and the anode stops working).It has a relatively low driving voltage, which means in higher resistivity soils or water it may not be able to provide sufficient current. However, in some circumstances, where there is a risk of hydrogen embrittlement for example, the low driving voltage is an advantage since overprotection is avoided. Read more about ourZinc Anodes... Magnesium Magnesium has the most negative electropotential of the three (see Galvanic series) and is more suitable for areas where the electrolyte (soil or water) resistivity is higher. This is usually on-shore pipelines and other buried structures, although it is also used on boats in fresh water and in water heaters. In some cases, the negative potential of magnesium can be a disadvantage. If the potential of the protected metal becomes too negative, hydrogen ions may be evolved on the cathode surface leading to hydrogen embrittlement or to disbonding of the coating , Where this is a possibility, zinc anodes may be used.  Read more about ourMagnesium Anodes... Zinc and aluminum are generally used in salt water, where the resistivity is generally lower. Typical uses are for the hulls of ships and boats, offshore pipelines and production platforms, in salt-water cooled marine engines, on small boat propellers and rudders and for the internal surface of storage tanks. Since the operation of a galvanic anode relies on the difference in electropotential between the anode and the cathode, practically any metal can be used to protect any other, providing there is a sufficient difference in potential. For example, iron anodes can be used to protect copper.

1216,"H1 Alloy  H1 Alloy Alloy H1 anodes are acceptable, in place of very expensive high potential alloys, for most applications where magnesium is required. MAG+(plus)â¢ anodes are produced to high standards of core wire, anode weight, and packaging. MAG+(plus)â¢ H1 anodes are formulated from an alloy of the correct chemistry and electrochemical properties that clients have come to expect from magnesium anodes: you get a high-potential, high efficiency anode at a fitting price. The typical open circuit potential of MAG+(plus)â¢ H1 using ASTM standard G97, is 1.57-1.60 volts with respect to a saturated Cu/CuS04 reference cell. The inherent potential of MAG+(plus)â¢ H1 is the reason that these anodes have a current output equivalent to similarly sized high potential anodes. These anodes have high current capacities, typically delivering 500-550 amperes hour per pound in the ASTM Standard G97-89 test.

1219," PROTOTYPE TO PRODUCTION Printed Sand Casting  We recently began offering sand castings using a printed sand mold process. The process uses 3D Printer technology to print a sand mold directly onto a print bed. This process eliminates the need for hard tooling. The process also supports geometries that were once restricted to production investment casting. Complex cores and undercuts are all easily achieved using this state-of-the-art system. The process can produce a limited number of sand molds in as little as 5 days from receipt of an order. Printed sand molds are appropriate for smaller quantities or for geometry that is not supportable using a traditional sand casting. The surface finish and mechanical properties are consistent with traditional sand castings, while the tolerances are much closer to air-set sand casting tolerances. This process is an excellent choice for larger castings that are too large to print in a wax pattern system. The printer is capable of making individual molds up to ~ 70” x 39” x 27”, as well as printing multiple simultaneous molds inside the print envelope. MADE IN THE USA Learn More ",1133,184
1219," PROTOTYPE TO PRODUCTION Permanent Mold Casting  USING OUR IN-HOUSE TOOLING DEPARTMENT, WE CUT A HARD TOOL FROM EITHER STEEL, OR GRAPHITE.  The tooling can be single or multi-cavity depending on part size and quantity requirements. Expected tool life can vary based on the tooling material and part geometry. As the name implies, Permanent Mold casting eliminates the cost of single use molds. Permanent Mold casting is a often an economical option for customers needing parts that would typically be small to intermediate sand castings. By eliminating the material and labor costs normally associated with sand casting, the casting costs can be made more affordable. Tooling for Permanent Mold casting is often less expensive than die casting since the metal is not under high pressure, and produces less stress on the tooling. Advantages:Consistent geometry; durable tooling can produce thousands of parts; can rapidly produce hundreds of castings; excellent option between sand casting and die casting. For future work here together, we have recently purchased our own production Permanent Mold machine.  We wanted this process in house to help you our customer have a source for Prototypes & Production quantities. We can then apply what we have learned together on your smaller run parts and then run full scale volumes together for years as you need. We took this next step for our business because we continue to innovate, listen to you our customers and aim for sustainable growth to manufacture more here in the USA under our facility.  As we get operational, we will market more than just the information on the machine and what it looks like it our Shop, but as you are a valued customer, we wanted you all aware.

1219," PROTOTYPE TO PRODUCTION History  Protocast Company History: Protocast was founded in 1995 in a small 2000 sqft shop just north of Denver, Colorado by Mike Kaiser and Kevin Fortin. Protocast Inc., was founded on speed and 3D printing technology Protocast utilized the dba Prototype Castings as that was the business focus. . The tooling process that was used to create molds started with SLA’s, urethane and silicon tooling was created from the 3D pattern. These tools were used to create plaster molds. Metal was then poured into the plaster mold to create the casting. In 1998 Prototype Casting moved to a larger shop in Northglenn CO. Protocast continued to grow and in 2000 moved to part of its current location in Denver. Mike Kaiser retired in 2011 and sold the business to longtime employee Chad TeBeest. Currently, Protocast occupies a total of 24,000 sqft. By 2012 the need to go into Production also coincided with a renewed focus on Protocast as the marketed name.  As time goes by and the business evolves, Protocast has aimed to stay in tune with its customers and their needs while keeping in alignment with our Vision and Mission Statement. Added processes as company grew and technologies evolved CNC Machining was added in 2002in response to customers request for complete parts verses just castings. Larger capacity CNC machines have replaced the first machine as well as added capacity. Currently Prototype Casting operates 10 CNC machines, we are capable of 5-axis operations and largest bed size of 60” by 120”. Sand casting was added in 2005with the addition of a Tinker Omega continuous sand mixer. Sand casting is a great compliment to the RPM (Rubber Plaster Mold), process the company was founded on. Sand casting currently makes up about half of our foundry business. Also in 2005, Prototype Casting began cutting tools from pattern board on CNC equipment.Thus replacing the tooling process the company was founded on. With the advancement in speed of CNC machining, and the increased processing power of computers for CAM programming, the choice was easy. The tools that are now produced are created faster, cheaper, and are more accurate then tools made from 3D printed patterns. Investment Casting was added in 2008.The process is slightly different than the traditional investment process, in so that we never create a tool. All of the castings are produced directly from a 3D printed pattern. This process works well for small, low volume, complex parts. This process is faster, cheaper, and provides an actual industry standard, fully dense casting when compared to DMLS (Direct metal laser sintering) In 2011, Mike Kaiser the co-founder soldProtocastto Chad TeBeest.Chad, had worked for Protocast for 7 years at the time. Mike loved the business that he founded and enjoyed success with, but wanted to retire and travel the country in his RV. In November of 2012,just 11 short months after entering full retirement, Mike Kaiser passed away of pancreatic cancer. During his last few months Mike was very happy to see his dream continue to grow. We will always remember Mike and many of his visions and directions, continue to guide Protocast. In 2013, Prototype Casting added the ability to heat treat castings in house. This increased the speed at which we could provide heat treated parts. The process typically took 2-3 days before, now it can be done in most cases overnight. In 2014, Prototype Casting purchased a HAAS gantry style CNC mill for cutting tools.This over doubled our tool cutting capacity and allowed us to provide better lead times to our customers. This machine also has a much larger bed (120”x60”) then our other CNC mills, thus increasing the size of tools that we can produce. In 2015, Prototype Casting greatly expanded the sand casting linewith the addition of a larger continuous sand mixer with dual hopper, automated controls, and mechanical reclaim. This allows Prototype Casting to move from just low quantity high quality to production quantities, while still maintaining the high quality demanded by the market place. The investment also represents the commitment of Prototype Casting to minimize its footprint for consuming natural resources, specifically the silica sand used in sand casting. Because of secondary markets for reclaimed sand, and the ability to reuse 80% of the sand in the process, the waste of sand to landfills will be completely eliminated!!! In Spring of 2017, we moved!Good afternoon, I hope you are doing well today.  It’s been a little while since our last correspondence and I wanted to check in and say hello and let you know what’s new with Protocast.  We have a lot going on these days.  It’s been a very busy summer getting moved into our new 50,000 sq ft building. Feb of 2020:Permanent Mold  - When most people think of casting, they think of the sand casts used to produce intricate parts and products. While yes, sand casting is one of the most recognizable forms of casting and is widely used as a favored production method, it is not always the most efficient type of cast — especially if your priority is quick production. December of 2020:Just a reminder that we have you covered for all of your foundry and machine shop related needs: Aluminum, magnesium, zinc & stainless steel – Investment casting – Precision Airset Sand Mold – 3D Printed Sand – CNC Machining – Tool Cutting – Zeiss CMM Inspection.

1222,"HOME ABOUT PENTACAST SERVICES CONTACT More SERVICES Quality die casting ​ The Die Cast process allows products to be made with a high degree of accuracy and repeatability. The die casting process also produces fine details such as textured surfaces without requiring further processing.  Unlike other manufacturing processes such as extrusion, the die casting process does not limit the shape of parts.  Die cast parts are able to withstand to a broader range of temperature, making it more ideal in harsh temperatures and working environments. ​ Since PentaCast can produce complexe parts to near net shape, there is little or no machining process required thus reducing the production time. ​ PentaCast uses both hot and cold chamber processes.  The hot chamber process has a short cycle time as it does not require metal to be transported from a separate furnace.  Cold Chamber Die Casting is used primarily for aluminum alloys. Permanent mold - gravity die casting machines ​ The Permanent mold process produces non-ferrous high density, high strength castings with a smooth surface finish compared to sand-casting. Good part repeatability, and the rapid solidification of metal creates fine grain structure with superior metallurgical properties. ​ Tilt pouring reduces turbulence as molten metal enters the die cavity, provides shorter cycle times, and requires less metal for feeding systems. Aluminum castings produced in metal molds have a tighter dendrite structure than castings produced in other processes. In addition, aluminum castings are harder and have better pressure characteristics. Value added options, such as sand cores or cast-in ferrous inserts are quite simple. Prototyping and low to high volume production processes ​ PentaCast specializes in the production of aluminum and zinc parts in prototype and low-high volume production quantities through our diverse processes.  Our operations are designed to deliver individual parts and complete assemblies very quickly. ​ Our proprietary casting processes shortens the time from conception to finished product. ​ Green Manufacturing:  According to scientists, plastics takes at least a few hundreds of years to degrade fully.  This means that obsolete plastic products are pilled up in the landfills, polluting and causing health hazards.  Unlike plastic, die casting parts are primarily made of recycled material.  On average, approximately 95% of the metal is recycled from salvaged parts making it a sustainable material that can be used over and over again without degradation. Engineering ​ At PentaCast we are continuously striving to improve our products through innovation and creative thinking.  We work closely with our clients and supplier partners to provide cost effective performance. ​ We have solid Strategic partnerships with market leader vendors & suppliers.

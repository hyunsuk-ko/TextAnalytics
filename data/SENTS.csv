14,1,0,Why Investment Casting
14,1,1, The investment casting process yields unrivaled quality to other casting methods
14,1,2," At Alpha Investment Casting, we produce hundreds of alloys from the simplest to the most complex designs"
14,1,3," Using our casting methods, combined with the design freedom of investment casting, our staff can consistently produce high quality parts with supreme repeatability"
14,1,4," When compared to other casting methods or weldments, there is no substitution for investment casting quality"
14,1,5," In many cases, certain machining operations can be eliminated with an efficient casting design"
14,1,6,  Our staff can work with customers to eliminate waste or unnecessary operations on new and current designs
14,1,7, Some specific benefits of investment casting are
14,1,8, Repeatability and Reliability Tolerances As cast tolerances are tighter than other casting methods
14,1,9, Standard Investment Casting Tolerances are
14,1,10," 0"" to 1"""
14,1,11,  ± 0
14,1,12,"010"" 1"" to 2"""
14,1,13,  ± 0

14,1,16,"020"" 3"" to 4"""
14,1,17,  ± 0
14,1,18,"025"" for each additional inch, add 0"
14,1,19,"005"" In many cases, tighter tolerances can be achieved"
14,1,20, Quality Investment Casting parts are visually more appealing than other casting methods
14,1,21,"  Because of the unique process small texts, company logos and other verbiage is easily readable"
14,1,22, A typical as cast surface finish with the investment casting process is 125 micro inches
14,1,23, Tool Life The tooling we use for our casting process is made from aluminum
14,1,24,"  With only our proprietary wax being used on the tooling, the tooling will last for decades with only minor repairs necessary"
14,1,25," Design Freedom When an investment casting design is utilized to its fullest potential, many design features that are traditionally machined can be cast to the part without adding cost"
14,1,26,  This allows our customers and our staff to design out cost before a part is ever produced
14,1,27,"  Intricate designs, logos, splines, thread profiles, thru holes and blind holes are just of few of the design features that we can cast"

37,1,0,About Us In 1962 Cast All Corp
37,1,1," was established in Mineola, NY"
37,1,2, At that time our principle product lines revolved around zinc die castings for window and door manufacturers and custom trade
37,1,3, In 1980 as the Window Industry evolved so did we
37,1,4," While still servicing all of the die cast needs of our customer base with parts as diverse as electrical stakes and air craft seat buckles, we began to produce plastic injection molded parts to meet the needs of the vinyl window market"
37,1,5," Today, working with quality engineered plastic resins we manufacture a wide variety of parts in these materials"
37,1,6," Tilt latches, end caps, screen corners, novelty items, just to name a few"
37,1,7," Frequently, we provide both zinc and plastic products to the same customers"
37,1,8," Where applicable, we introduce plastic molded parts to replace metal ones often doing away with secondary operations resulting in considerable cost savings"
37,1,9, We would be honored to add you to our list of satisfied customers
37,1,10, Please feel free to contact us for a competitive quotation on any zinc die cast or plastic part utilized in any commercial application
37,1,11, 
37,2,0,"Die Casting&Injection Molding With a full on site tool room, molds are fabricated in house with rapid prototyping capability"
37,2,1, From inception to final production of successful parts we partner with our customers every step of the way
37,2,2, Molds for both zinc die cast and plastic injection can be amortized to spread the cost of the mold over a long period of time
37,2,3, Where long running high volume jobs are contracted we often provide the tooling at no cost
37,2,4, Our goal is not to meet but to exceed your expectations

44,5,0,Rapid Prototyping 3D PRINTING AND CNC FOAM MACHINING We have the capability to manufacture casting prototypes using both 3D printing and machining from high density foam and then cast those designs in a range of metal alloys
44,5,1," Although the finish may not be to the same high quality as a part from wax, a fully functional casting will result"
44,5,2," As significant skill and expertise is applied in the development phase with one-off castings such as prototypes, costs are higher than production run quantities"
44,5,3, Rapid prototyping is ideal for
44,5,4,  In view of the popularity of 3D printing this process tends to dominate with FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) also known as FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) using PLA the most common method and the process we use
44,5,5, In some circumstances machining foam can be preferable
44,5,6, We have considerable experience using both methodologies
44,5,7, We have a number of 3D printers with extensive 3D printing capability and can print designs up to 500mm x 500mm x 500mm
44,5,8, We can also join multiple 3D printed and foam machined parts to build complex designs
44,5,9, The larger sizes may subject to handling constraints limiting just how large a part can be cast
44,5,10," Surface finish will generally not be as good as a part from wax as printing artifacts will remain, even after a tidy up"
44,5,11," Lamination lines and signs of the support structures generally remain visible, but surprisingly good results can be achieved with some effort"

53,2,0,Call Zinc Die casting OVERVIEW
53,2,1, Zinc die casting is a very meticulous process that every detail of the casting must be considered in order to come up with a product that is to produced
53,2,2," Also, these should be accomplished in the safest and the most economical way"
53,2,3, How Zinc Alloy Die Casting Works
53,2,4, The Zinc Alloy die casting process is a forming process in which molten metal is injected into the cavity of hardened steel die
53,2,5," The cavity is precision machined, with tight tolerances, into a block of heat resistant tool steel"
53,2,6," With casting process control and the uniform shrinkage charactreistic of zinc alloys, this process results in castings with exact precision"
53,2,7," The process of zinc alloy die casting, the production cycle is the fastest of all metal casting processes due to zinc’s relatively low in melting and solidification temperature (379-390C)"
53,2,8, Zinc casting is used to produce parts from less than a gram in weight to a kilo or more

53,2,11, Contact Us 
53,3,0,Call Tooling TYPES OF TOOLING
53,3,1," Typically, a zinc die casting die is quite expensive"
53,3,2," And, many times the only difference from one die to another is some cavity feature"
53,3,3, Many zinc castings are similar except for styling
53,3,4, Others can be grouped into categories of similar sizes even though the castings are otherwise quite unrelated
53,3,5, The designer can often achieve considerable tool construction economy by fitting the die into a standard die set or unit die
53,3,6, Standard Die Set ( Stand-Alone Dies )
53,3,7, Complete die assembly can be purchased
53,3,8, These are available commercially
53,3,9, Many dies can use these standardizations as basic building blocks for die
53,3,10, Increase in standardization there is usually a reduction in the original cost of the die and a reduction in construction lead time
53,3,11," But, there are trade offs"
53,3,12," As tooling standardization becomes more rigid, die set-up, casting yield, and production efficiency may be sacrificed"
53,3,13," Naturally, when there are no advantages, the highest level of standardization should be used"
53,3,14," When there are trade offs, each option should be analyzed for its total cost effectiveness"
53,3,15, These items are pre-machined to catalogued sizes
53,3,16," These sets contain all the necessary blocks, plates and rails plus sprue bushing, sprue spreader, leader pins, ejector plate guide pins, and ejector plate return pins"
53,3,17, These items are evenly bolted together
53,3,18," The die builder must install the cavity blocks, ejector pins, and water cooling"
53,3,19,  Unit Dies
53,3,20, Unit dies provide for relatively quick changing of cavity block in the bolster or die block

53,4,1, Some castings require more than the normal breaking off procedure when taken from the machine
53,4,2, This process involves the trimming of the casting or removal of overflows and runner in-gates
53,4,3," It also takes care of any flashing, etc that is surplus to the casting"
53,4,4, Vibratory Finishing
53,4,5," This process involves removing of burrs, smoothing and brightening surfaces"
53,4,6, Castings are vibrated with a medium of ceramic cones and mixture of polishing liquid
53,4,7," The liquid compound is used to keep parts clean, lubricate, cushion against damage and remove all debris from the vibratory finishing machine"
53,4,8," After the vibratory process, they are automatically transferred to a dryer, which prepares the casting for linishing / polishing etc"
53,4,9, Linishing
53,4,10," This process involves grinding, polishing and removal of roughness and part lines which feature on some castings"
53,4,11, Normally when zinc is formed part lines are visible and sanding is the most efficient way of removing these
53,4,12, There are many different kinds of linishing machines that suit your needs

53,6,1, Is a type of coating that is applied as a free flowing dry powder
53,6,2, The main difference between the conventional liquid paint and a powder coating is that the powder coat doesn’t require a solvent to keep the binder and filler parts in a liquid suspension form
53,6,3, The powder coating is typically applied electrostatically and is then cured under a heat to allow it to form a “skin”
53,6,4, The powder maybe thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer
53,6,5, it is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than a conventional paint

56,1,0,BailSco The Air Moving People Airfoil Propellers Bailsco manufactures a variety of cost affective cast aluminum airfoil propellers to meet most industrial applications
56,1,1, Our propellers range in size from 18” up to 96” with many blade quantities and blade types available
56,1,2, Propellers types include both fixed and adjustable pitch
56,1,3, Airfoil designs include standard and reversible flow
56,1,4, Many Bailsco propellers have been in service for over twenty years
56,1,5," Bailsco’s computer selection program allows for the optimization of propeller selection for a specific design application (CFM, HP, and SP)"
56,1,6, The program can either search all propellers for the desired performance or the search can be confined to specific diameters and speeds if desired
56,1,7, Generated performance curves include
56,1,8," octave sound data, performance at a desired temperature and elevation as well as standard conditions"
56,1,9, The programs allow the selection of the proper “pitch match” of the airfoil design to meet virtually any set of conditions for the maximum cfm at the lowest horsepower

56,2,0,BailSco The Air Moving People Adjustable Pitch Propellers Bailsco’s adjustable pitch propeller (VIA and VIP) can be adjusted in the field
56,2,1, This product offers a sure method of insuring that each blade is correctly pitched to meet the design requirements of the propeller
56,2,2, It is often necessary to vary the pitch of the individual blades of a propeller in order to vary the performance characteristics of the propeller and/or to optimize the performance of the propeller relative to the output capabilities of the propeller’s power source
56,2,3," The VIA (Vari-Insert-Aluminum) and VIP (Vari-Insert-Plastic) is designed to provide a variable pitch blade in which the mechanism for setting and locking the blade in a desired pitch position is easily interchangeable, is easily fabricated, provides wide flexibility in setting a desired blade pitch position, and provides positive locking along the entire root shank of the blade to be fixed"
56,2,4, This is accomplished by the use of locking inserts which slip into sockets in a hub half
56,2,5," Changing the pitch is done easily by unbolting the hub halves, removing the inserts, replacing the inserts with different pitch inserts, and bolting the two hub halves together again"
56,2,6," No more protractors, just change inserts and go"

58,1,1, has extensive experience in the aluminum sand casting foundry industry
58,1,2," The process of pouring molten aluminum into a sand mold continues to be a cost effective process, supplying parts to a variety of industries"
58,1,3," Because of its positive features, aluminum remains the metal of choice across the automotive industry"
58,1,4," Notwithstanding the automotive industry, aluminum sand casting continues to be used in other areas of the transportation industry including in aircraft and marine applications"
58,1,5,"Other industries served include machine tool fabrication, communication, medical and laboratory testing equipment, and food preparation machinery"
58,1,6," Aluminum sand casting is the right choice for products that require hollow cavities and complex, unique arrangements of voids, shapes and ribs"
58,1,7, Aluminum sand castings can be supplied in sizes from fractions of an ounce to 400 pounds

58,2,0,"Hebert Foundry and Machine, Inc"
58,2,1, is a family owned and operated business with nearly 100 years of experience in the green sand casting and machining industries
58,2,2," Our staff of engineers, patternmakers, and metallurgists will ensure that your company chooses the right material and pattern to address your green sand casting needs"
58,2,3, Green Sand Casting continues as the most widely used and cost effective process for sand casting
58,2,4, The process begins with the creation of a pattern that duplicates the shape of the desired part
58,2,5," Depending on the application of the part and desired outcome, HFM offers two sand compositions for the no bake sand casting process"
58,2,6, One no bake sand casting process utilizes a molding material that is low cost and reusable
58,2,7," Typically, green sand is composed of washed, graded, dried, and screened/sized silica sand that is bonded with various natural clays and water"
58,2,8, Other ingredients are used to achieve specific properties to allow molten metal to be formed in “near net shape”
58,2,9, The alternative composition utilizes sand molds of chemically bonded sand that are only used once
58,2,10, This process is superior for heavier castings and generally exhibits better dimensional control than traditional green sand
58,2,11, The “no-bake” molds can be assembled to form intricate castings
58,2,12," Cores, created from various compositions within the mold cavity, form the internal (and sometimes intricate) structure of hollow castings"
58,2,13," The green sand casting process, and the no-bake sand casting process, facilitates the casting of complex parts"
58,2,14, Castings produced from green sand handle vibration and stress much better than assemblies secured by fasteners
58,2,15," HFM green sand castings reduce weight and furnish rounded edges that are safer and more aesthetically pleasing than sharp, machined edges"
58,2,16, The green sand casting process reduces the need for assemblies which significantly minimizes the need for machining and ultimately improves the tolerance of the finished product

82,6,1,"com Zinc Die Casting Zinc Die Castings, while being over twice as heavy as aluminum, have many uses in the everyday products we use today"
82,6,2, Zinc alloys offer tight tolerances and extremely repeatable production processes
82,6,3, SDC uses Frech fully automatic zinc machines producing parts ranging from a few grams to 2
82,6,4,5 pounds
82,6,5, Zinc parts can be produced to extremely fine detail with very little draft required on sidewalls and cored holes
82,6,6, Zinc Die castings tooling is long lasting and easy to maintain compared to Aluminum tolling
82,6,7, The melting temperature is lower in zinc die casting as well as the pressure required to produced the casting is much less than aluminum
82,6,8, If your part is a part requiring close tolerances or thin complex shapes zinc die casting may well be the answer to saving special machining operations
82,6,9, Our team will be happy to assist you in your evaluation
82,6,10, Zinc Alloys Zinc-based alloys are the easiest to die cast
82,6,11," Ductility is high and impact strength is excellent, making these alloys suitable for a wide range of products"
82,6,12, Zinc alloys can be cast with thin walls and excellent surface smoothness making preparation for plating and painting relatively easy
82,6,13, It is essential that only high purity (99
82,6,14,99 + 0/0) zinc metal be used in the formulation of alloys
82,6,15," Low limits on lead, tin and cadmium ensure the long-term integrity of the alloys strength and dimensional stability"
82,6,16, Zinc-aluminum (Za) Alloys ZA alloys represent a family of zinc-based die casting materials which contain higher aluminum content than standard zinc alloys
82,6,17, These alloys provide high strength characteristics plus high hardness and good bearing properties
82,6,18, Thin wall castability characteristics and die life are similar to zinc alloys
82,6,19," ZA-8 is recommended for hot chamber die casting, whereas ZA-12 and ZA-27 must be cast by the cold chamber die casting process"
82,6,20, All ZA alloys offer similar creep properties and are superior to standard zinc alloys
82,6,21, Four-Slide Die Casting Four-Slide Zinc Die casting is a special method of Die Casting requiring a special type of Die Casting machinery
82,6,22, SDC uses Dynacast Model 2A machines
82,6,23," While being limited on size (Max part weight 40g), the machines are extremely efficient & highly accurate"
82,6,24, Parts are cast to net shape at speeds up to 40 shots/min
82,6,25, Most tooling for the 4 slide machine will be more economical than for conventional die cast tooling
82,6,26," If you require small complex parts in high volumes over 25,000 per order, the multi-slide approach may be you best solution"
82,6,27," Typical applications are connectors, small housings, office parts, small valves, munitions components, air fittings, special components, fractional motor brackets, Nano technology packaging"

106,2,0,Permanent Mold Including Tilting Furnaces Introduction to Permanent Molding Permanent mold casting is accomplished through the use of an iron (typically cast iron) mold
106,2,1," The use of permanent molds, while somewhat costly to initially build the mold, benefits from a lower per casting cost on longer runs and complex parts can be made with much better quality and repeatability"
106,2,2, Our foundry uses two types of permanent mold
106,2,3," base mounted permanent mold that is gravity (ladle) poured, and furnace mounted tilt pour molds that use a small amount of automation and the pressure of a pool of molten aluminum above the part being cast, to ensure complete filling of the mold and therefore a good casting"
106,2,4, When designing a permanent mold the following should be considered when engineering the part to be cast
106,2,5, minimum wall thickness of -
106,2,6,"125 inches for distances less than 3 inches and more for longer distances, minimum inside and outside radius equal to "
106,2,7,"125, minimum draft angle of 1° on outside surfaces and 2° on inside surfaces should be heeded to promote a good design"
106,2,8, Typical tolerances 
106,2,9,020 on the first inch and 
106,2,10,002 per additional inch as accuracy guidelines
106,2,11, Typical part sizes range from 1 ounce to 20 lbs
106,2,12, and more
106,2,13, Much larger parts can be cast using a permanent mold if the quality required justifies the cost of building the tooling
106,2,14, Permanent mold castings are gravity-fed and the pouring rate is kept quite low
106,2,15, The metal mold causes rapid cooling
106,2,16, This supports a relatively quick cycle time to using the mold and helps to achieve a lower casting cost
106,2,17, Permanent mold castings provide excellent mechanical properties when made with an appropriate alloy
106,2,18, The mechanical properties of permanent mold castings made with certain alloys (for instance A356) can be further improved by heat treating
106,2,19, Heat treating brings these alloys to full strength and hardness

254,15,6, Benefits
254,15,7, Uses
254,15,8, Why use Skirtliners
254,15,9, Skirtliners are used in a feed hopper along the bottom edge of the sidewall to stop dirt and rock that has dropped onto a belt or an apron feeder pan from spilling over the edge
254,15,10," Skirtliners form the shape of the belt load as the belt carries the material away, to ensure it is not overloaded and doesn’t spill over"
254,15,11, Depending on the speed of the belt and the abrasiveness of the material it can be a high wearing area
254,15,12, It is desirable to have the bottom of the skirt liner running as close as possible to the passing belt because should a rock  lodge between the belt and the liner it can rip the belt  causing major disruption while it is repaired and costing a large amount to fix
254,15,13, For this reason it is important to be able to adjust the liner height
254,15,14, How do Skirtliners work
254,15,15, Keech Skirtliners can be changed out by one person and result in reduced shut down times
254,15,16, Maximum wear protection extends the life of valuable mining and industrial equipment

259,1,0,"Mold Making To determine the kind of tooling needed to make your plastic part, you should know the estimated annual usage or EAU"
259,1,1," Most parts that have an annual usage of more than 10,000 for simple geometry and 50,000+ or more on complex geometry are feasible"
259,1,2," Just to clarify, some parts are produced in the millions yearly byplastic injection moldingwhile some highly specialized parts that can only be injection molded may be produced in very small lot sizes"
259,1,3," EAU of 100,000+ are normal in the custom injection molding business range of 50-250 ton press capacities, but are not a prerequisite"
259,1,4, A well-maintainedplastic injection moldcan continue to produce consistently accurate parts well beyond 10 years
259,1,5, Extremely intricate parts can be produced in mass at a low cost with a properly constructed mold
259,1,6, Some high wear materials such as glass fiber reinforced plastic may require hardened tool steel inserts

259,2,1,Our custom plastic injection mold design process involves accurate communication with thecustomer that defines their specific needs
259,2,2," This can be accomplished with the digital transfer of information, reverse engineering, drawings, specifications and standards"
259,2,3, Then we design the digital model of the mold and analyze the model to optimize the performance of each mold to achieve the best results
259,2,4, Requirements
259,2,5,"We will require your complete specifications, including"
259,2,6," the geometry of the part, the material type or specification the part is to be molded from, the appearance and color requirements for the part, a tolerance standard such as ISO or DIN that is applicable to any dimensions not otherwise specified"

259,3,0,In-Mold Assembly Many of the injection molded products Mountain Mold & Die produces are also assembled in our plant
259,3,1, Some are assembled at the press as they are molded
259,3,2, This is a natural progression that many custom plastic injection molding companies make
259,3,3, We may provide case studies depending on your product or business line
259,3,4, Innovative material properties–including chemical bonding in the over-molding process–now allows for elegant part geometry that was impossible with other means of attachment or assembly
259,3,5, We started using these materials as early as 1996 when a customer needed a solution for over-molding an automotive key that included a RFID transponder
259,3,6,"Over the next several years, our ability to provide ingenious solutions made us an industry leader in this product line"

259,4,1, We have extensive experience in these fields as we have been milling 3-D surfaces since 1988
259,4,2," We also have the ability to Wire-Cut 5 axis profiles on metal parts up to 2,500 lbs"
259,4,3,", and up to 12 inches thick"
259,4,4," We are not a high production wire-EDM shop that cuts 20-100 of the same parts each day, but we do have these unique capacities that we offer"
259,4,5," MIG & TIG Welding Services Tool steel welding up to 4,500 lb"
259,4,6, is available in our plant
259,4,7, Typically used for mold repair the most common type is H-13 tool steel
259,4,8, Some stainless tool steels can also be welded with excellent results
259,4,9, Most hot-work type tool steels “H-**” can be welded with excellent results
259,4,10, The geometry of the part and the area to be reconstructed generally define the effort required to successfully weld any workpiece
259,4,11, Many jobs require a preheat process to reduce the risk of cracking the workpiece
259,4,12," On most die steels, welding is not recommended as they often crack"
259,4,13," If the work piece hardness is greater than 56, Rockwell “C” standard TIG welding is not advised"

259,5,1, While assembling  over 30 million transponder automotive keys in the past 20 years our  ability to eliminate restrictions to workflow have been honed to a  razor edge
259,5,2," We will typically improve the production rate of transferred  or converted lines by a significant amount, also reducing scrap and  improving measurable quality indicators"
259,5,3," What sets us apart is that while we  were a contract manufacturing company assembling those 30 million RFID  keys for the automotive industry, our  expertise in assembly increased  dramatically"
259,5,4," We never try to reinvent  the wheel, but we do maximize  the throughput of each process in a cost  effective manner"
259,5,5," Based on results  during the past 15 years, when an  existing line or assembly cell has  been transferred to our facility, an  increase in production of 50-100% can be achieved"

284,0,0,"Ron Adamson Studio and Artworks Original Western Art About  Ron Adamson grew up next to the Kootenai River near the small lumber and mining town of Libby, Montana"
284,0,1, His interest in art showed up at an early age as he painted the model airplanes and cars that he loved to assemble
284,0,2,"  In particular, he wanted to save the plastic decals that came with the models and would instead paint the decal images onto the models"
284,0,3, Ron learned to carve the bark of Cottonwood trees as a teenager and would eventually choose to illustrate characters from the local native and frontier culture
284,0,4,"   He researched the clothing of trappers and settlers, and the traditional costumes of first nations people in order to represent them accurately"
284,0,5, Ron began experimenting with acrylic paint at the end of his teen years
284,0,6,  One of his first significant works is shown at left
284,0,7," “The Birches”, 1975"
284,0,8, Ron started working with bronze sculpture in the 1980’s
284,0,9,  Each step of the process takes a lot of time
284,0,10,  A clay model of the intended statue is only the beginning
284,0,11,  A rubber mold is made of the clay and provides a vessel where a wax replica of the clay model can be created
284,0,12,  From the wax replica a ceramic mold is made and used to finally cast the bronze
284,0,13,  In larger statues there can be many pieces cast separately that must then be cleaned up and welded together
284,0,14, Ron created his own foundry in 1990 to learn every step of bringing a bronze statue to life
284,0,15,  “Honkers” was the first bronze cast in Ron’s foundry
284,0,16,"  It won the Best of Show sculpture award at the 1993 “Celebration of Western Art” show held each year in Puyallup, Washington"
284,0,17," Ron started working with stone in the late 1980’s, primarily alabaster"
284,0,18,  He produced several pieces awarded Best of Show in juried exhibitions across the Pacific Northwest
284,0,19,"  In his most recent adventures Ron has returned to chainsaw carving, and working with much larger pieces of wood and carving tools"

340,12,2, P is expressed as pressure or pounds per square inch on the projected area of the bearing
340,12,3, V is velocity in feet per minute of the wear surface (surface feet per minute)
340,12,4," For sleeve (plain) bearings, the surface speed is "
340,12,5,262 (pi ÷12) x RPM x shaft diameter in inches
340,12,6, P is equal to the load on the bearing in pounds divided by the projected area in square inches
340,12,7," For sleeve (plain)bearings, the projected area is the length x the inside diameter of the bearing"
340,12,8, PV is then obtained by multiplying P x V as shown in the following example

349,2,3," Fill out the form below, or contact ourFabricated Gates Sales Manager, Rich Korbe"
349,2,4, Fabricated Slide & Weir Slide Gates can be mounted to head walls or channels and are used in situations where cost effective flow control                     of water is desired
349,2,5, The gate slides up to permit the flow of water underneath the gate
349,2,6, Weir gates are designed to slide down in order to maintain upstream water levels or provide a better view of water                     flowing across the gate
349,2,7, Radial Radial gates (also known as Tainter gates) have a large convex surface which dams the upstream flow                     of water
349,2,8, The gate is supported by radial arms attached at either side that are mounted                     to trunnions which allow the gate to pivot up and down
349,2,9, This design allows economical construction                     and operation of gates which need to control the flow of water in large openings
349,2,10, Overshot Overshot gates (also known as pivoting weir gates) are used to control upstream water levels
349,2,11," In principal,                     they are similiar to a sliding weir gate, but instead of sliding down, the gate pivots on a hinge attached                     at the bottom of the gate"

408,2,21, Cronite can support you with
408,2,22, The new generation of CFC alloy hybrid fixtures Optimize your Total Costs of Ownership As world leader in the Heat Treatment market the Cronite Group already offers a wide variety of cast refractory steel and CFC solutions
408,2,23," In fact Cronite designs, produces and assembles multiple carbon products at its Arnage plant in France"
408,2,24, This ranges from graphite furnace parts to the most complex 3D CFC fixtures
408,2,25," The strength of the Cronite Group is to master the design and production of these products in  the different materials, refractory cast steel and CFC"
408,2,26, Cronite Group’s design office and research and development center have developed a new generation of products combining the benefits of cast refractory steel and CFC
408,2,27, These are our hybrid fixtures
408,2,28," This technology is particularly effective for high-temperature, vacuum heat treatments and low-pressure carburizing process"
408,2,29, The principle is simple
408,2,30, Combine the benefits of both material families to compensate for their weaknesses
408,2,31, And this to ensure the best lifespan of the product and at the best cost
408,2,32, Thus the CFC will be used to lighten the structure and make it more resistant
408,2,33, But only where it is needed
408,2,34," Cast refractory steel, due to the flexibility in the forms that can be made and by its cost, will constitute the rest of the design"
408,2,35, The complex shape of the parts to be supported in a fixture can be complicated to make in CFC where a casting can be designed to a shape that perfectly fits the contours of the part to be treated
408,2,36," Similarly, not all structural elements require the use of CFCs"
408,2,37," In many cases, for example, the base tray and vertical grids can remain cast steel"
408,2,38, The example of ring gears fixtures for low-pressure carburizing illustrates the concept very well
408,2,39, This is just one example of the many custom bespoke combinations that the Cronite Group’s design office offers to its clients on a daily basis
408,2,40, It’s your turn to take the plunge and submit your projects to us

454,6,0,Advantages Advantages of Aluminum Sand Casting Process The sand casting process offers many distinct advantages when compared to alternative metal casting methods
454,6,1," When the versatility, unit costs, quality, availability and all other factors are considered, using sand molds for manufacturing aluminum castings is the clear choice"
454,6,2," Aluminum parts cast in sand molds, and which will be machined, are highly competitive with gray iron, notwithstanding the higher cost per pound of material"
454,6,3, The following represents some of the clear advantages of the aluminum sand casting process
454,6,4," Flexibility of DesignIntricately cored parts and parts with feet, bosses or other unwieldy protuberances can be cast soundly"
454,6,5," Wide Range of Alloys and Properties AvailableProperties range from 16k to 50k tensile with varying degrees of machinability, corrosion resistance, etc"
454,6,6, Lowest Tooling Cost – Shortest Lead TimeUnmachined patterns are cheaper and faster to build lower overall the overall cost of casting production and shortening turn-around time
454,6,7, Long Tool LifeThe aluminum sand casting process uses expendable molds
454,6,8," Hot metal, which causes deterioration of permanent-mold tooling and adversely affects quality of the cast parts, never touches the tooling (pattern)"
454,6,9," High Production Rates for Large Range of PartsThe many molding options available to sandcasters, from squeeze jolt machines to high pressure automatic molding machines, combined with the use of multi-impression matchplates, permits the manufacture of thousands of parts per day"
454,6,10," Ease of Product ModificationWith shorter “Life of Product” cycles than in the past, the ease of altering tooling is increasingly important"
454,6,11," Least Sensitive Gating, Feeding and Heat Removal System in Mass ProductionPouring temperatures in permanent molds should be held to +/- 20° for optimum results"
454,6,12," In sand, good castings can normally be obtained with temperature differences as high as +/- 40% and generally in a much lower temperature range"
454,6,13, High Density Molds Produce Good Surface FinishHigher mold squeeze pressures combined with technological improvements in sand preparation produce castings with a surface finish that rivals the permanent mold processes

457,10,0,219-362-8531 The Shell Mold Process  Hiler Industries boasts two modern foundries that produce millions of castings every year â all using the shell mold process
457,10,1," Since 1946, we have been providing our customers the highest quality castings, in a variety of metals, all with an excellent surface finish and near-net shape"
457,10,2, Superior Machining QualitiesA major benefit of shell molding is the excellent machining characteristics achieved through this process
457,10,3, Many photomicrograph inspections have shown that shell castings have what might be termed âcooling rate inversion
457,10,4,"â Unlike green sand castings, permanent mold and die castings â which all have hard skins and âsoftâ interiors â shell mold castings have âsoftâ skins and hard or dense interiors"
457,10,5," As a result, shell mold castings have superior machining qualities vs"
457,10,6, green sand and other types of castings
457,10,7, Less WeightAnother major benefit is that less machining stock is required
457,10,8," Over the years, we have found that "
457,10,9,060 stock is more than ample
457,10,10," In fact, if the job were to be machined in our machine shop, we would add only "
457,10,11,040 stock

487,7,0,Cylinder Blocks Our rebuilt cylinder blocks go through a thorough 8-step process that provides high quality and product longevity
487,7,1,  You won’t find a better-quality re-manufactured block anywhere
487,7,2," We service Caterpillar, Detroit Diesel, Cummins, Waukesha, White Superior and International cylinder blocks"
487,7,3, We also maintain a large supply of the most popular castings for immediate exchange in case of emergency
487,7,4,     Coastal casting align bores the block or frame and can laser check most blocks or frames
487,7,5, We will give a report showing your alignment results
487,7,6,  Repairing the Upper and lower O Ring areas    Block Reconditioning Procedures 1
487,7,7, Full rebuild (Zero Hour)2
487,7,8, Custom Machine Work3
487,7,9, Special Instructions Full Rebuild consists of the following 8 step process
487,7,10, Step 1
487,7,11, Identify the Block Each block is identified with a Coastal Casting work order number(usually a 4-5 digit number with the letter”B” at the end)
487,7,12, This number is usually near the serial number
487,7,13, Step 2
487,7,14, Cleaning & Inspection The block is stripped of any non essential parts and is placed in a caustic soda vat overnight
487,7,15, The unit is then steam cleaned and water jacket sandblasted if necessary
487,7,16," Finally, the block undergoes a comprehensive 100% wet magnaflux inspection by a NDT trained professional"
487,7,17, Step 3
487,7,18, 1st Visual Inspection A Coastal Casting block specialist will review the entire unit and document any issues that may arise
487,7,19," During this phase of the inspection, our specialist will focus on the integrity of seal areas, decks, water passages and bolt holes"
487,7,20, Step 4
487,7,21," Align Bore Evaluation During this phase of Coastal Casting’s 8 Step Block Procedure a block specialist will evaluate and document the condition of the cam, main bores, cap fit, thrust, alignment and centerline"
487,7,22, Incorrect centerline or over-sized bores are then corrected using the ABS approved spray weld process
487,7,23, Step 5
487,7,24," Vertical Machine Work During this phase the decks, liner seat areas and lower seal areas are addressed"
487,7,25, Fitted interference inserts are then installed and re-machined true in the original location
487,7,26, We then mill the decks as minimally as absolutely possible in order to achieve acceptable cleanup
487,7,27, If low decks are identified they can be corrected using the METCO spray weld process
487,7,28, All areas are machined in accordance with the factory re-manufactured guidelines
487,7,29, Step 6
487,7,30," Detailing The block is then thoroughly cleaned, all gaskets are polished and the unit receives a final wash"
487,7,31, Step 7
487,7,32," Final Inspection At this stage, a comprehensive inspection is performed on all vital elements and dimensional readings are recorded to verify unit accuracy"
487,7,33, We then create a final report that is to be stored on file with CCS and issued alongside the block during final delivery
487,7,34, An optional laser alignment report can also be obtained in most cases
487,7,35," If a laser alignment report is requested, one of Coastal Casting’s certified Ludeca Laser System operators will perform all necessary testing and reporting"
487,7,36, Step 8
487,7,37," Paint, Crate, & Shrink Wrap Once the block has passed our rigorous inspection process it is painted, preserved, packaged in a crate with a sturdy 2×4 base and a 1×12 top that covers the decks, banded and shrink wrapped"
487,7,38, Custom Machine Work Custom machine works usually consist of first 5 steps of the rebuild process and we repair only what is not serviceable
487,7,39, Special Instructions Special Instructions apply only when the customer has dictated what needs to be repaired
487,7,40, The customer will be fully responsible for the condition and the integrity of the block in all other areas that we will not be focusing on
487,7,41," However, if we happen to notice something else, we will bring it to the attention of the customer at once"
487,7,42," We are not responsible for any charges that are involved if we should, for example, be completed with the align bore job that we were instructed to perform and then find a crack elsewhere in the block"
487,7,43," Most likely, if the block would need welding, then the align bore would require more attention afterwards, which would be of considerable more expense to the customer"
487,7,44, We are glad to perform any of the details as outlined above
487,7,45, We communicate thoroughly with the customer regarding both Special Machine Work and Special Instructions
487,7,46," We want to achieve customer satisfaction and, in the event of Special Machine Work or Special Instructions, many questions may be necessary to make sure you can visualize what we understand you to want"
487,7,47," Zero Hour is the easiest for us because there is no window for misinterpretation, but we understand that not all jobs call for the attention that is required to render Zero Hours"
487,7,48, We can supply you with the best rebuilt blocks or the best custom work available
487,7,49, We are able to do this by quality control
487,7,50, quality control and more quality control
487,7,51, Note in the step-by-step procedures the different steps that we take to check and double check
487,7,52,It is our goal to supply components that are ready to install
487,7,53, Brand “X” components usually require much attention from the mechanic to “make it work”
487,7,54," Not ours – just wash off the preservative, insure that oil galleys are clean, install all plugs in the proper places and build your engine"
487,7,55, Our components can be assembled as if they were new
487,7,56, Your mechanics will recognize the ease of assembly and appreciate this aspect of our work
487,7,57, You will recognize longevity that properly reconditioned blocks have to offer

494,2,0,"Design & Process Guidelines When designing a casting, active participation should take place between the Design Engineer, the casting producer and the machining source"
494,2,1, Meloon Foundries LLC does this through direct contact with the casting buyer
494,2,2, Pattern or ToolingA significant variable in the construction of a pattern is the determination of the shrink factor
494,2,3, The shrink factors vary for different metals and also the configuration of the part
494,2,4," The number of impressions, the gating system, the process or methodology will affect the casting cost"
494,2,5, This is better left to the foundry and pattern maker to determine
494,2,6, Process GuidelinesIt is important that the foundry and the casting purchaser work closely together in order for the casting producer to make an acceptable cost effective part
494,2,7, Producing a casting for the first time entails a certain amount of trial and error
494,2,8,It is an experienced-based development process
494,2,9, The expertise and past experience with similar casting configurations provide a guideline for the initial production
494,2,10, Usually the more intricate the casting design and the more drastic the change in section thickness the less predictable the casting soundness
494,2,11,"This is why it is important to consider location of isolated heavy sections, uniform wall thicknesses and correct placement or ribs and junction design"
494,2,12, Visual casting soundness many times is not sufficient to verify acceptability and machining the sample casting prior to production release is important
494,2,13, SpecificationsOver specifying can increase the cost of a casting appreciable
494,2,14," Proper alloy selection, welding permissibility, correct choice of temper, and final inspection criteria all figure into casting cost"
494,2,15,Under specifying leads in many cases to misunderstanding between the casting producer and the casting supplier
494,2,16, Castings that are designed for critical applications require specific quality criteria
494,2,17, Selection of material that does not meet environmental or mechanical properties frequently leads to poor casting performance
494,2,18, New Jobs Rapid PrototypingRapid Prototyping is the developing of a temporary pattern or tooling from a 3-D computer design
494,2,19, This temporary tooling reduces casting time from months to days
494,2,20, The computer model is used as the blue-print and its dimensions to produce a model
494,2,21, Any rapid prototype pattern that is durable enough to withstand green sand or no bake molding can be used
494,2,22, There are several rapid prototyping processes and the selection depends on the application
494,2,23, 
494,3,0,Green Sand Casting in Bronze An architectural industry client approached Meloon Foundries to green sand cast 250 bronze columbarium face plates
494,3,1, The plates which required artistic detail as well as weather-resistant characteristics were green sand casted using floor molding
494,3,2,"Each of the C89833 bronze weather resistant face plates measured 15′ long, 15′ wide, and "
494,3,3,25′ thick and were visually inspected and straightened

494,3,9,00′ thick
494,3,10, Standard tolerances of +/- 
494,3,11,030” were held
494,3,12, Spiders range in size from 16′-72′
494,3,13,"After the process was complete, each of the 50 lbs spiders were visually inspected and then straightened to guarantee that they met the specifications outlined in the prints supplied by the customer"

507,2,1,"com(413) 283-2976 HyDuct5™ HyDuct5™ As the leader in vacuum tight and dimensionally stable aluminum castings, we are proud to announce the launch of a new alloy, HyDuct5™"
507,2,2, This high ductility aluminum alloy is perfect for applications where high ductility is required
507,2,3, Additional benefits include superior corrosion resistance and excellent plating and anodization properties
507,2,4, The table below summarizes the relative performance of these materials compared to the 356 series
507,2,5," Relative ratings (1=excellent, 2=good, 3=fair, 4=poor) From Table 1 it is easily recognized that 356-T6 suffers from poor dimensional stability while 356-T51 has poor machining characteristics"
507,2,6, Both of these alloys also suffer from medium corrosion resistance and weak anodization properties
507,2,7, These drawbacks limit design flexibility and performance while increasing costs
507,2,8," In comparison, HyDuct5™provides excellent properties for applications where high ductility is demanded"
507,2,9," This alloy can also be used in marine applications where corrosion resistance is a must, and its anodization appearance make it an excellent choice for cosmetic parts"
507,2,10, The one limitation of this alloy is applications where pressure or vacuum tightness is required

542,2,14," We allow at least 24 hours to cool, then the casting is removed from the mold"
542,2,15, Each drum casting can weigh as much as fifty pounds when this step is completed
542,2,16," The Machining After cooling, the shells move into the machining process"
542,2,17," Here, material is removed from the shell to bring the shell thickness down to your specifications"
542,2,18," Finishing Touches After machining, your shell moves over to the mill where we cut in snare beds (if desired), drill mounting holes for your lugs and snare strainer, and drill a vent hole"
542,2,19, Final Inspection It’s been a long road to get this far
542,2,20," Typical build times are 6-7 weeks, as drums are created in batches and need to be scheduled in with other jobs at the foundry"
542,2,21," In this last stage we perform a final inspection, comparing the finished product to your specifications one final time to ensure everything is 100% correct"
542,2,22, Shells and rims are very carefully packed in heavy-duty containers (along with the hardware you sent us earlier) and shipped to your address
542,2,23," Okay, enough reading"
542,2,24, It’s time that we start building your ideal shell

542,4,0,What type of brass is right for you
542,4,1," CA907 / “Bell Bronze” CA907 is the “original” brass used in the manufacturing of drums, and is frequently referred to as bell bronze"
542,4,2, This alloy is created from 90% copper and 10% tin
542,4,3," The finished product has a deep bronze coloring, but will have some “smudging” from it’s final tooling"
542,4,4," That effect can be seen from above, but isn’t this noticeable in-person"
542,4,5, CA954 / “Aluminum Bronze” CA954 is our newer drum alloy
542,4,6," It’s made from roughly 84% copper, 11% aluminum and 5% iron"
542,4,7," This alloy isn’t as common for drum making, but we like the way the finished product looks"
542,4,8," It has a very even, consistent finished look that takes on a brushed appearance"
542,4,9,  We haven’t been able to identify a difference in sound between the two alloys

542,5,1, Both are created from the same CA954 material and are machined in-house
542,5,2," They are available in 13” or 14” sizes, and can be finished with either 8, 10, or 12 lugs (or whatever other number of lugs you want"
542,5,3,)
542,5,4, Standard Rims These are the rims that we’ve been producing since the beginning
542,5,5," They are machined from pieces of extruded CA954 brass, and feature weight-saving cutouts between lugs"
542,5,6, Snare-side rims feature cutouts for your snare wires
542,5,7, Heavy Rims We also offer a “heavy” version of our rims
542,5,8," These are similar to standard rims, but we don’t remove the material between lugs"
542,5,9, The result is a rim that weighs in at close to twice the weight as our standard rims

579,3,0,"Ironmaking Products Standard Blast Furnace Tuyeres To perform reliably, a Blast Furnace tuyere must not only have optimal design, but it must also be produced with very high purity copper to allow for maximum heat transfer"
579,3,1," Tallman blast furnace parts are made to x-ray quality standards and by utilizing only the highest purity electrolytic copper, we have among the highest conductivity in the industry"
579,3,2, Tallman tuyeres are designed and manufactured to meet and exceed the tough demands of today's modern Ironmaker
579,3,3, Tuyeres with High Velocity Spiral Cooling Modern blast furnace operations require tuyeres that can withstand increasingly severe operating conditions
579,3,4," While traditional flooded tuyere designs incorporate a single water inlet and outlet, in the event of nose wear or damage, the water must be shut off and the tuyere must be replaced immediately"
579,3,5," Modern, dual flow tuyere designs allow the water to be shut off to the nose section only, allowing the tuyere to be replaced on the next scheduled outage, avoiding an unforeseen delay"
579,3,6," Tallman takes the concept of a dual flow tuyere to the next level with intensive, computer optimized nose cooling designs, including radiused chamber and high velocity spiral designs"
579,3,7," In addition, centrifugally cast tuyere noses are available using the same grain refinement technology used in Tallman's EAF and BOF lance tips, to increase wear resistance and improve overall life of the tuyere"

579,3,13,5mm/year
579,3,14, These inserts are engineered to provide long term service life at hot blast temperatures up to 2200°F (1200°c)
579,3,15, Calorized Tuyeres Blast Furnace tuyeres must perform reliably in the harsh environment they are placed
579,3,16," Standard tuyeres fail prematurely due to iron drips that dissolve the copper and create ""Bullet Hole"" defects"
579,3,17, Calorizing is a pack diffusion process where the copper tuyere is placed in a sealed retort containing aluminum powder
579,3,18," The casting is heated and aluminum is diffused into the surface, creating a copper aluminide inner layer and an aluminum oxide outer layer"
579,3,19, Calorizing creates a protective layer on the copper tuyere that preventing liquid iron drips from penetrating the surface
579,3,20, The calorizing process is performed at the final stage of production after the tuyere is finished machined and hardfacing alloys are applied
579,3,21, Calorizing eliminates the need to use refractory materials on the top surface of the tuyere
579,3,22, Services Content Calorizing Calorizing is a pack diffusion process where the copper casting is placed in a sealed retort containing aluminum powder
579,3,23," The casting is heated and aluminum is diffused into the surface, creating a copper aluminide inner layer and an aluminum oxide outer layer"

595,2,0,Main Navigation The Manufacturing Process Investment Casting The investment casting process involves making a wax duplicate of the casting by injecting wax into an aluminum mold
595,2,1, Several copies of the wax part are then assembled onto a sprue to create a “tree”
595,2,2, The wax tree is then dipped into a ceramic slurry several times to create an outer shell coating
595,2,3," Next, the shell is placed in an oven to melt and drain out the wax, thus creating cavities ready to receive molten metal"
595,2,4, The metal is poured into the shells creating the castings
595,2,5," Once the metal has cooled, the shell is knocked off leaving a “tree” consisting of the castings, ingates and sprue"
595,2,6," In the finishing department, the castings are cut off the tree, and finished by grinding or sanding any remnants of the ingates"
595,2,7, Advantages Design Considerations Sand Molding The No-Bake Sand casting process involves creating a mold using sand and resin
595,2,8, Sand is packed around a pattern that contains the imprint of the casting to create a cope (top half of sand mold) and drag (bottom half of sand mold)
595,2,9," Molten metal is poured into the sand mold, through the runner and gating system and allowed to cool and solidify"
595,2,10,  The sand is broken away from the metal and recycled to create more molds
595,2,11,  The metal casting is finished by cutting and grinding any excess metal
595,2,12,"  Further processing may include heat treating, machining or painting"

595,4,4,  It works like this
595,4,5, 1
595,4,6, A solid model file is used to 3D Print the actual part in plastic or wax and the dimensions are scaled up slightly to account for metal shrinkage
595,4,7, 2
595,4,8, The 3D plastic part is used as a pattern to make the metal casting
595,4,9,"  The 3D printed pattern can be used in both processes (sand and investment casting), the same way regular patterns are used"
595,4,10, 3
595,4,11," By using 3D printing the customer will avoid the cost of making a permanent mold or pattern that can typically cost between$4000 – $5000, so it may be more economical for small quantities"

621,2,6,3961  Rapid Prototyping The popularity of additive manufacturing technology and rapid prototyping has not left the investment casting industry behind
621,2,7, in fact we were doing it long before the average person knew the technology existed
621,2,8," For decades, Acra Cast has been providing quick turnaround deliveries for prototype and low volume castings using 3D printed patterns in lieu of wax patterns and traditional wax injection tooling"
621,2,9,"Using customer provided CAD data, patterns can be printed in just a few days and castings poured in under a week"
621,2,10, Secondary operations such as heat treatment and machining will add to delivery times
621,2,11,"Because the 3D pattern replaces only the wax pattern, we’re still pouring into a ceramic mold so virtually any alloy we cast in production can be used to produce protoype castings"
621,2,12,The excellent surface finishes and tolerances our customers have come to expect from Acra Cast production castings can be duplicated using rapid protoype technology
621,2,13,"In summary, using Acra Cast as your source for rapid prototype castings offers the following advantages"
621,2,14," Extremely quick deliveriesUses industry standard CAD formatsNo permanent tooling is requiredThe same great alloy selection as used in production castingsValidate designs with one or more generations of protoypes before going into full scale productionCompress timelines from concept to marketPerfect for a ‘one off’ repair part or specialized applications  Acra Cast1837 First StreetBay City, MI 48708989"

701,0,5," For example, on an project such as theDubai Terminal 3, Hycast completed the following design steps to ensure the product met the the load and design constrains"
701,0,6, 3D Computer Modelling
701,0,7,The first step of the design process is to develop a 3D computer model of the proposed casting and its components
701,0,8, Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
701,0,9,The FEA is a linear static finite element analysis of the casting to demonstrate the maximum developed stress when design loads are applied
701,0,10, Casting Simulation
701,0,11,Technology is used to simulate and visualise the entire casting process
701,0,12, This allows the team to establish the most effective and timely process minimising defects and maximising throughput
701,0,13, Rapid Prototyping
701,0,14,"Rapid Prototyping technology combines computer modelling with automated wax printing to produce a ""near perfect"" single casting"
701,0,15," This technology is important as it allows the client to confirm shape, form and finish prior to the commencement of tooling"
701,0,16," World Class Manufacturing & Quality     Hycast Metals is in a constant frame of mind of ""continual improvement"" and has obtained the relevant certifications/accreditations to achieve that goal"

701,0,30, Process Wax Injection
701,0,31,Wax replicas of the desired castings are produced by injecting tooling with wax
701,0,32, These replicas are called wax patterns
701,0,33, Assembly
701,0,34,"The wax patterns are attached to a central wax runner bar, to form an investment tree"
701,0,35, Shell Building
701,0,36,The shell is built by immersing the tree in a liquid ceramic slurry and then coating in a refractory product
701,0,37, Up to 5 layers may be applied in this manner
701,0,38, This stage is the creation of the “Investment mould”
701,0,39, De-Wax
701,0,40,"Once the ceramic shell is dry, the wax is melted out, using an autoclave creating a negative impression of the assembly within the shell"
701,0,41, Casting
701,0,42,The investment mould trees are fired in an oven and pulled out while hot
701,0,43, The shell is then filled with molten metal by gravity pouring
701,0,44," After the mould has been filled, the molten metal is allowed to cool and solidify into the shape of the final casting"
701,0,45," Cooling time depends on the thickness of the part, thickness of the mould, and the material used"
701,0,46, Knock Off
701,0,47,"When the metal has cooled and solidified, the ceramic shell is broken off"
701,0,48, Cut Off
701,0,49,The parts are then cut away from the central runner bar using a high speed cut-off saw or band saw
701,0,50, Finishing
701,0,51,Finishing operations such as grinding or sandblasting are used to smooth the part at the gates
701,0,52, Heat treatment may be specified to add further treatment to the final part
701,0,53, Inspection
701,0,54,All parts are inspected for quality and shipped to the customer

703,1,0,The Eagle Bronze Story I got my first real exposure to the art industry after I had married my beautiful wife Beverly
703,1,1,"  Her father Bud Boller was and is a known respected artist in Wyoming, known mostly for his bronze sculpture, but is amazing with a pencil as well"
703,1,2,"  Before we begin the journey down the road to Eagle Bronze, let me first take you to the beginning, because without this beginning, I would not be in the art business after all"
703,1,3,"I know this is many, many years back, but the story really starts before I even left high school for college"
703,1,4,"  Through high school, I had always had my eyes on a younger girl that had lived just done the street from my parentâs home in Lander"
703,1,5,  A very cute little gal that I used to adore from a distance
703,1,6,"  Not in the âstalkerâ way, we hadnât really heard of this term in those days"
703,1,7,"  Truth be told, it seems she stalked me, in the form of binoculars from her house as I worked on chores in the yard"
703,1,8,"""Lander is known nationally as âthe City of Bronzeâ â Main St"
703,1,9," features more bronze statues percapita than any other town its size in the country, thanks to the presence of Eagle Bronze Foundry and Gallery"
703,1,10,"""Wyoming and Lander Tourism/Development DepartmentMy âstalkerâ wife, moreover my high school sweetheart, and I did end up getting married and headed off to college at the University of Wyoming"
703,1,11,  I studied Mechanical Engineering and my wife studied art
703,1,12,"  We braved the cold winters of Laramie, and after I graduated, we moved to the Loveland area so I could work as an engineer for Eastman Kodak"
703,1,13,On a side note about my stint with Eastman Kodak
703,1,14,  They of course hired me right out of college
703,1,15,"  Before we officially moved to Colorado to take on my role with Eastman Kodak, we were sent to Rochester, New York for training"
703,1,16,"  Being from Wyoming, we were somewhat naÃ¯ve and oblivious to some goings on around us"
703,1,17,  We apparently were living on the âwrong sideâ of the tracks the whole time we were there
703,1,18,"  We found out later when we returned to Colorado, that we were living in very close proximity to a famous mob hang out, the âChatter Boxâ"
703,1,19,"  Not believing we were in any danger and with the Lord on our side, I even played basketball with some of the neighborhood guys"
703,1,20,"  Being a whitey with a indefensible hook, I earned the nickname âCool Breezeâ"
703,1,21,Now back to the story
703,1,22,"  After some time in Colorado, we moved to Colville, Washington so that I could work with my dad on his ranch and also took a full time engineering job at Alcoa"
703,1,23,"  Needless to say, I was very busy keeping our ranch going, working as a full time engineer, and now trying to help raise a family of four daughters"
703,1,24,"  Burning the candle at both ends, the Lord started to prompt my spirit, some times flat out hit me, and started to move me in a different direction"
703,1,25,"  After my father passed away at an early age from cancer, it was only a matter of time, before I felt a different calling to my life"
703,1,26,"To make long story short (too late), we decided to move back to our hometown of Lander, Wyoming so that we could start a smallsculpture foundryto produce Beverly's father's bronzes and I to pastor a Vineyard Church"
703,1,27,  I guess the Lord had slightly other plans
703,1,28,  We have taken our little foundry operation to one of the largest in the world
703,1,29,"  Having redesigned the way we build and engineer monuments, we have been told that we are the largest producer of monuments in the world, and can do them quicker than most, keeping the integrity that the artist had originally produced"
703,1,30,Beverly also started sculpting along the way and is a very gifted and talented artist
703,1,31,  Her ability to create softness and life in everything she sculpts is truly a gift from the Lord
703,1,32,  Her work has kept our vision of ministry going
703,1,33,"  I may not be the pastor I thought I was called to be, but I have been able to see the impact Bevâs art has had and been able to use this as a tool to minister to people along the way"
703,1,34,"  God was calling me to ministry, just not how I had seen it"
703,1,35,"Along the way, we added some additional help to our facility"
703,1,36,"  In 1999, my oldest daughter Heather and her husband Matt decided to join our fight and help run our business"
703,1,37,  Heather studied accounting in college and is now our Controller
703,1,38,"  Matt, having studied Structural and Mechanical Engineering in college, is now our Vice President"
703,1,39,"  With the addition of these two, we now have the ability to expand our operations and move in directions we never would have if they were not present"
703,1,40,We have rebranded Eagle Bronze to move in a direction that has made us more than just a fine art foundry
703,1,41,"  We have become an art marketing group that can take conception to completion, help our artists find and place projects, and much more"
703,1,42,  We have become a facility that can do more than just recreate and manufacture art

705,0,2, Why Lost Wax Process Casting
705,0,3,Lost wax process investment casting is the closest you can get to a net shape manufacturing process
705,0,4," Using the lost wax method, EPS investment castings produce parts so close in tolerance that, in many cases, no further machining or finishing is necessary"
705,0,5," Once the initial tooling is perfected, every subsequent casting is an identical copy of the original"
705,0,6, You save time and money
705,0,7, Your customer gets a better product
705,0,8, Here’s how
705,0,9, Gain Design & Materials FlexibilityInvestment casting affords more freedom of design and access to a wider range of alloys than shell or sand castings offer
705,0,10, EPS routinely casts more than 120 ferrous and nonferrous metals
705,0,11," Eliminate Tooling Set-upBy offering near-net-shape configuration, fixturing costs are substantially reduced or eliminated altogether"
705,0,12," Reduce Production CostsPrecise dimensional tolerance of the lost wax process often eliminates machining on some surfaces, thus reducing costly finishing operations"
705,0,13," With EPS as your investment castings source, the only capital equipment investment required to produce the parts is the tool"
705,0,14, Cut Assembly OperationsLost Wax process investment castings allow the replacement of multi-component parts with a single part
705,0,15," Several parts can be made as one casting, reducing handling, assembly and inspection costs"
705,0,16," Reproduce Fine DetailsThe ability to reproduce fine details using the lost wax process allows EPS to produce a vast array of products from very close tolerance pressure fittings and valves to intricate trophies, medals and figurines"

705,3,0,The EPS Lost Wax Investment Casting Process Lost wax investment casting is a craft that has been practiced for thousands of years
705,3,1," At EPS, we have incorporated many innovations, which allows us to produce finely detailed cast parts quickly and accurately using a large variety of alloys"
705,3,2, The following is a simplified explanation of our casting process from start to finish
705,3,3,  The Pattern A wax pattern is created for each casting in the exact geometry of the part to be completed
705,3,4, This pattern is generally made by injecting wax or plastic into a metal form or die
705,3,5," The die is an aluminum tool that is more or less sophisticated, depending on the application or requirements"
705,3,6, Each form or die may be as simple in design as the head of a golf club or as complex as a minute valve system for a rocket
705,3,7,"  The Cluster Multiple wax  patterns are attached together forming a cluster or ""tree"" of the same pattern, allowing a large number of parts to be cast at the same time"
705,3,8,"  The Mold Each cluster is dipped in a ceramic slurry, which is drained and coated with fine ceramic sand, then dried"
705,3,9,"  Final Mold The dipping process is repeated again and again using progressively coarser grades of material until a thick, self-supporting shell has been formed"
705,3,10,"  Dewaxing Once the shell is dry, it is heated to cause the wax to run out"
705,3,11, The wax is collected for reuse
705,3,12,  Pre-Heating The clusters are pre-heated in a furnace to prepare for casting
705,3,13,  Pouring The specified molten metal alloy is poured into the cluster
705,3,14,"  The Resulting Castings After the poured cluster has cooled, the ceramic mold material is removed from the castings by mechanical vibration and chemical cleaning, leaving the tree of castings"
705,3,15,  Finished Product Each part is cut away from the cluster and smoothed
705,3,16," Some parts are ready to ship at this point, while others may go through  final machining or other operations"

716,1,0,"About Us Trusted for over 80 years On 15 April 1937, two partners – Alexander Dingwall and William Price – decided to start a steel foundry that would supply South Africa’s growing mining industry"

789,4,5,A Abrasion and Wear Resistance
789,4,6,Conventional indentation hardness tests or Rockwell tests do not generally determine the relative wear resistance of REXALLOY®™ as compared with other materials such as tool steels
789,4,7, High carbon-high chrome tool steels commonly used for maximum resistance to abrasion or wear can be heat treated to about 64 Rockwell C (885 VPN)
789,4,8," REXALLOY®™ , for non-cutting applications, has a hardness of about 54 Rockwell C (654 VPN)"
789,4,9," However, the hardness of the individual micro-constituents gives an entirely different picture"
789,4,10," The primary carbides in REXALLOY®™ are much harder than the large carbides in high carbon-high chrome tool steel, 1810 VPN as compared to 1390 VPN, although the matrix in REXALLOY®™ is softer, 488 VPN as compared to 840 VPN"
789,4,11," Thus, the conventional Rockwell tests provide an average hardness which mask the effect of hard and soft constituents in a CAST heterogeneous alloy of this type"
789,4,12, It is the large surface area of massive primary high-hardness carbides which produces the wear resistant quality of REXALLOY®™ 
789,4,13," TABER Wear Test ResultsThe samples were tested to 10,000 cycles with a 1000 gram load – 500 grams on each wheel"
789,4,14," The abrading wheel was H-1O calibrade, a wheel designed for alloys resistant to abrasion"
789,4,15,"After 10,000 cycles, results as follows"
789,4,16, Additional Features Resistance to Scaling
789,4,17,REXALLOY®™ has considerable resistance to oxidation and scaling
789,4,18, During heating no visible oxide film is formed until the temperature exceeds 9001Ú4 F
789,4,19, Scaling tests indicate that REXALLOY®™ has a scale resistance comparable to Rezistal 310 at temperatures up to 20001Ú4 F
789,4,20, Forming and Heat Treatment
789,4,21,REXALLOY®™ 33 cannot be formed in any way by hot or cold working and does not respond to heat treatment
789,4,22," Its high hardness is obtained in the AS-CAST condition, and is not appreciably affected by heating at temperatures up to 20001Ú4 F"
789,4,23," However, heating REXALLOY®™ cutting tools at temperatures above 1600 F causes a gradual reduction in their cutting life over time"
789,4,24, Grinding
789,4,25,REXALLOY®™ is generally finished by grinding
789,4,26," Any soft wheel, not coarser than 46 or finer than 60 in Grade “X” or “J”, is suitable for machine-grinding REXALLOY®™ "
789,4,27, Light feeds should be taken to avoid heat checking
789,4,28, REXALLOY®™ tools should not be quenched during grinding
789,4,29, REQUEST A QUOTE Machining
789,4,30,The lower-hardness type of REXALLOY®™ for non-cutting applications can be machined with tungsten carbide tools
789,4,31," All types of REXALLOY®™ castings are being successfully turned with several grades of carbide tools at a surface speed of 25-40 feet/minute, a feed of "

789,4,34,020 inches without coolant
789,4,35, REXALLOY®™ can be drilled or reamed with masonry-type carbide drills using slow speeds fine feeds and a coolant
789,4,36, Brazing
789,4,37,REXALLOY®™ is most satisfactorily joined to steel or other REXALLOY®™ parts by brazing
789,4,38, It is never recommended to attempt to weld REXALLOY®™ 
789,4,39, Silver solder and a paste flux are recommended for brazing
789,4,40," The essentials of the process consist of grinding and cleaning the face, applying the flux, inserting the brazing strip between the faces binding the parts together with Nichrome wire, heating carefully to 13501Ú4F to 14501Ú4 F and applying pressure as the brazed solidifies on cooling"

789,4,51, The next important property of REXALLOY®™ is its superior resistance to corrosion
789,4,52," In laboratory tests, standard REXALLOY®™ 33 was found to be resistant to the following"
789,4,53," On the other hand, REXALLOY®™ is not satisfactorily resistant to 2% Hydrochloric Acid at 15001Ú4 F, nor to boiling 65% Nitric Acid"
789,4,54," Thus REXALLOY®™ successfully resists corrosion by moist atmosphere salt spray, the milder acids and certain of the stronger acids and alkalies"
789,4,55," When the use of REXALLOY®™ in highly corrosive media other than those listed above is contemplated, specific inquiry is recommended, and testing should be done for your proposed application"

801,4,2," Contact Us Airboat Frequently Asked Questions You may either click on a question to view the answer, or simply scroll down the page"
801,4,3, Describe an Airboat
801,4,4, An airboat is a water transportation vehicle and can be used for many purposes
801,4,5, The propeller of an airboat is used to achieve forward motion by turning up to 2800 RPM's
801,4,6," The propeller itself being an airfoil, while turning generates thrust directly out the stern of the airboat"
801,4,7, The rearward thrust propels the airboat forward
801,4,8," All propulsion and navigation functions are in the air, not in the water, which gives the airboat capability of navigating on land or water provided that the airboat is constructed with a ultra high molecular plastic and or a polymer bottom and that the airboat has a sufficient thrust to weight ratio to move"
801,4,9, You steer the airboat by a rudder or rudders positioned in the air stream at the rear of the boat
801,4,10, An airboat is a wind machine that is very similar to an airplane with respect to how it operates
801,4,11, Back to Top What are the advantages of having an Airboat
801,4,12, There are several advantages to having an airboat
801,4,13, An airboat can go just about anywhere on land or water that most ordinary boats can not
801,4,14, Airboats can operate in the shallow waters such as swamps and marshes or in deep waters
801,4,15, Airboats can go up to 70 miles per hour
801,4,16, Even faster on snow and ice if you DARE
801,4,17," The propulsion system on an airboat is never in the water, it is entirely above the water and any engine leaks would be collected in the bottom of the hull"
801,4,18, Also the airboats do not project sound or vibration in the water like an ordinary boat would
801,4,19," The sounds made by an airboat occur at a low frequency, allowing a closer approach to wildlife"
801,4,20," An airboat can be used for personal airboating, aquatic control, law enforcement, seismograph, hunting, and fishing and there are so many other reasons for owning an airboat"
801,4,21, Back to Top What is a Airboat Belted Reduction Drive Unit
801,4,22, In 1989 Robert R
801,4,23, Eakin received a U
801,4,24,S
801,4,25, Patent for his invention which is the Airboat Belted Reduction Drive Unit
801,4,26, This drive unit is a belted transmission that was designed for airboats which will attach an automobile engine and the propeller
801,4,27, The belted drive unit allows the engine to achieve its maximum sustainable rpm's while turning the propeller at its normal rpm to increase thrust and reduce the noise levels
801,4,28, Century Drive Units Inc
801,4,29, continues today to manufacture the quality products that airboat users have come to expect and trust
801,4,30, Back to Top Why would it be better to have a Belted Reduction Drive Unit
801,4,31, Airboats can use belted reduction drive units to increase torque
801,4,32," By using a 2 to 1 ratio belted reduction, the auto engine will rev up to 5,200 RPM's while allowing the propeller to turn at 2,600 RPM's for more torque and greater power"
801,4,33, With this belted reduction drive unit you will get the maximum torque transfer to turn your propeller
801,4,34," An engine with a belted reduction drive unit will swing a bigger propeller, a propeller with more blades, and a greater angle of attack or (more pitch)"
801,4,35," A wider, longer propeller turning lower RPM's will produce the same if not more thrust as a small propeller at high RPM's and produce far less noise"
801,4,36, The key to a quieter airboat is to keep your tip speed as close to or under 
801,4,37,6 mach
801,4,38, To calculate your tip speeds use the following formula
801,4,39,"Diameter x RPM's ÷ 256,000 = mach Example"
801,4,40," 82"" x 2000 RPM's ÷ 256,000 = "
801,4,41,641 mach A belted reduction drive unit is the most cost effective method to use the horsepower produced
801,4,42, The performance of the airboat will increase by the amount of the ratio of reduction
801,4,43," Horsepower is constant and cannot be increased through a transmission, however you can increase torque output to the propeller, which makes for a faster and quieter airboat"
801,4,44, Our belted reduction drive unit requires minimal maintenance
801,4,45, Back to Top How do you produce more torque and thrust at lower propeller RPM's with larger diameter propellers
801,4,46, You can achieve this by using a 2
801,4,47,"3 to 1 ratio belted reduction drive unit from Century Drive Systems, Inc"
801,4,48, There are other ratios available for you to choose from
801,4,49, For best results use a high performance engine with a roller cam and lifters designed to operate at 5000 RPM's
801,4,50, A marine or automotive engine with a belt reduction drive in combination with a composite wide blade propeller is an industry standard
801,4,51, Almost any mechanic can repair an automotive engine with a belted reduction drive unit
801,4,52, Back to Top What are the maintenance requirements for Airboat Belted Reduction Drive Units
801,4,53, Detailed instructions as follows
801,4,54, Back to Top How do I adjust the drive belt on my Airboat
801,4,55," Remove the 9 3/8"" - 16 hex cap screws from the upper assembly"
801,4,56, Then while holding pressure inward turn the bearing holder clockwise to tighten the belt
801,4,57," Temporarily put in (4) 3/8"" - 16 x 1½"" cap screws"
801,4,58," Then rotate the engine a few revolutions by hand without starting the engine, to center the belt"
801,4,59, Check the belt tension by having a helper hold downward on the propeller tip to make a slack side to the belt
801,4,60, Then by feeling the amount of belt deflection
801,4,61, The belt should be snug but not drum tight
801,4,62," If your belt is too tight, you could cause premature pulley or bearing wear"
801,4,63," Readjust to the proper tension, then put in all (9) 3/8"" - 16 cap screws and lock washers, then rotate through again and recheck"
801,4,64, It is normal to hear some belt rumble between 600 - 850 RPM
801,4,65, If you hear a belt whine noise the belt is most likely to tight
801,4,66, Back to Top How do I grease my belted reduction drive unit for my airboat
801,4,67," Century Drive Systems, Inc"
801,4,68," recommends using (2) pumps of Pennzoil Red Grease, Stock # 7772 or equivalent every 16 - 20 hours of unit operations"
801,4,69, Apply grease in (2) upper bearings and (1) lower bearing with only (2) pumps per bearing using the recommended high-temperature bearing grease
801,4,70, (CAUTION
801,4,71, DO NOT OVER-GREASE BEARINGS) Adding too much grease may cause damage to the dust and grease seals which could result in premature wear
801,4,72," After 5 - 10 hours of operation, it is recommended that all drive unit bolts be re-torque and verify that the lower bearing set screw or ring clamp are still tight"
801,4,73, For Counter Rotating Upper Assemblies
801,4,74,The first oil change on our Counter Rotator Upper Assemblies should be done after (20) hours of breaking time and then we recommend changing your unit oil every (6) months or (100) hours of use
801,4,75, Do not forget you still must give the lower bearing (2) pumps of grease every 16 - 20 hours
801,4,76, Back to Top How do I remove the Outboard Lower Bearing
801,4,77," Unbolt the bearing by removing the (4) 3/8"" - 16 x 2"" cap screws and loosen either the set screw bearing (SFC-24) or remove the lock ring bearing (SFC-24TC)"
801,4,78, Polish any exposed shaft area out past the bearing to remove any rust
801,4,79, Then apply some penetrating oil to help remove the inner race of the bearing remove from the shaft
801,4,80, Rotate the outer flange portion of the bearing so that the (4) holes are not over the (4) tapped holes in the main case to avoid damaging the case threads when removing the bearing
801,4,81, All (4) holes in the bearing flange that is used to bolt the bearing on have ½ - 13 NC threads inside
801,4,82," Use (4) pieces of ½"" - 13 x 5"" long all thread with (2) nuts jammed together on one end of each to act as draw bolts turning all (4) all thread equally to draw the bearing off the shaft"
801,4,83, Be sure to only turn draw bolts (1) revolution each at a time
801,4,84, NOTE
801,4,85," You may need (2) aluminum shims about 1/8"" thick to place on the inside of the housing between the end face of the lower pulley and the housing"
801,4,86, This will give the pulley a positive stop and keep you from bending your flexplate
801,4,87," Once the bearing is off the shaft, you should verify the shaft size"
801,4,88, Our specifications on the shaft end is 1
801,4,89,4995 diameter + 
801,4,90,0002 - 
801,4,91,0000
801,4,92, You may still use the same shaft with as much as 
801,4,93,002 undersize as long as you are sure that either the set screws or lock ring on the bearing are firmly secured to the shaft to keep the shaft from spinning inside of the bearing's inner race

859,5,7,   Plaster Mold ToolingPlaster Mold With Core Installed   Tooling
859,5,8,"  Patterns are built out of water resistant materials, such as urethane, and mounted on cope and drag plates"
859,5,9, Core boxes are developed when required from the same materials
859,5,10,  Plaster Mold
859,5,11,"  Once the patterns are created, they are set-up as needed and a specially formulated plaster slurry is poured over them to form the upper and lower mold portions"
859,5,12,  Cores
859,5,13,"  If the part requires cores (to create passageways, etc"
859,5,14,"), a special plaster slurry is poured into a core box"
859,5,15," When the plaster hardens, the core is removed from the box"
859,5,16,  Mold Assembly
859,5,17,  Mold sections and cores are assembled to create the complete mold
859,5,18, This mold is then baked in ovens to remove any moisture from the mold
859,5,19,  Pouring Metal
859,5,20,"  After bake-out, molten metal is poured into the molds"
859,5,21,  Plaster Removal
859,5,22,"  After the metal has solidified and cooled, the molds are broken away by vibration or high pressure water blasts"
859,5,23, The castings are then cut from the gate and deburred
859,5,24,  Solid Mold Investment Process  The Solid Mold Investment casting process (aka Lost Wax process) is an economical way to produce high quality castings using a wax pattern
859,5,25,     Tooling
859,5,26,"  Metal dies, usually aluminum, are produced from the customer's specifications"
859,5,27,  Wax Injection
859,5,28,"  High pressure injection systems fill the cavity in the dies with wax, producing a pattern"
859,5,29,  Assembly
859,5,30,  Wax patterns are attached to gating (flow channels) and mounted to an aluminum plate
859,5,31,  Plaster Slurry
859,5,32,  Plaster slurry is poured over the wax pattern in a vacuum chamber to form a mold
859,5,33,  Burn-Out
859,5,34,"  After the molds are created, the wax is melted out using a gas-fired dewax furnace"
859,5,35,  Pouring Metal
859,5,36,"  The ""void"" left by the wax will be filled by molten metal"
859,5,37,  Plaster Removal
859,5,38,"  After the metal has solidified and cooled, the molds are broken away by vibration or high pressure water blasts"
859,5,39, The castings are then cut from the gate and deburred
859,5,40,  Precision Sand Process   Precision sand is an effective way to produce high quality castings using a no-bake sand mold
859,5,41,   Tooling
859,5,42,  Patterns are built using urethane tooling
859,5,43, Core boxes are developed when required
859,5,44,  Sand Mold
859,5,45,"  Once the patterns are created, sand is mixed via an automatic mixing system using a specific percentage of airset binder"
859,5,46, They are set-up as needed and the sand mixture is poured in them to form the upper and lower mold portions
859,5,47,  Cores
859,5,48,"  If the part requires cores (to create passageways, etc"
859,5,49,"), core blowing machines blow sand into core boxes"
859,5,50, The machine has a mixture of sand and chemical hardener that allows the sand to harden quickly
859,5,51,  Mold Assembly
859,5,52,  Mold sections and cores are assembled to create the complete mold
859,5,53,  Pouring Metal
859,5,54,  The molten metal is poured into the molds
859,5,55,  Sand Removal
859,5,56,"  After the metal has solidified and cooled, the molds are broken away by vibration"

859,5,58,"  Technical Design Data  Cast Alloys HTCI, Co"
859,5,59," can meet the requirements of the majority of material specifications available, including MIL-A-21180"
859,5,60,"Aluminum Alloys319, 356, 357, 380, 535 (Almag 35)C355, 203 (RR-350)  Tolerances Normal cast tolerances are ± 0"
859,5,61,01 for the first inch and then ± 0
859,5,62,005 inch per inch thereafter
859,5,63,  Closer tolerances are available on selected dimensions
859,5,64,"  Because cost increases in proportion to dimensional requirements, it is important that tight tolerances be assigned to functional areas and other tolerances be generous to obtain the most economical design"
859,5,65, The following table indicates what generally can be held
859,5,66,  Tolerances for geometric tolerancing are in proportion to the linear tolerances above
859,5,67,    Basic linear tolerance E1 call outs represent tolerances on one side of the parting line only
859,5,68, For dimensions that cross the parting line add E2 to E1
859,5,69, For dimensions including features in both the mold itself and in core add E3 to E1 and/or E2
859,5,70, The amount of additional tolerance for E2 and E3 is determined by the projected area of either the casting at the parting line for E2 or the projected area of the core in contact with the casting for E3
859,5,71," For dimensions which cross the parting line, defined in part by core or are in some other way additive, these tolerances may require some expansion"
859,5,72, The foundry should be consulted and good judgment is recommended

919,11,1, AND WHY DO YOU NEED IT The requirements issued by the National Electric Code (NEC) that a corrosion-resistant conductive structure with a surface area of at least 9 square inches must be installed in contact with the water and connected to the equipotential bonding grid
919,11,2,  This ensures that the pool water and the equipotential bonding grid have the same electrical potential

919,13,0,Perma-Cast Anodes Salt System Corrosion Salt System Swimming Pools
919,13,1, Sanitation of swimming pools using chlorine generators has become the method of choice for the pool professional
919,13,2, The addition of salt to the pool water creates a more corrosive environment for metals in the pool
919,13,3, A number of variables affect the actual corrosion of metals in pools
919,13,4," PH, water temperature, total alkalinity, chlorine levels, salt concentration levels and improper metal bonding can all contribute to corrosion of metals in the swimming pool"
919,13,5," It is essential to maintain proper water balance with respect to PH, chlorine, and total alkalinity"
919,13,6, Proper monitoring of salt concentration levels is critical in controlling metal corrosion
919,13,7, Salt levels should never exceed the maximum concentrations recommended by the Salt System Manufacturer
919,13,8," In addition, all metal components must be bonded according to accepted construction practices"
919,13,9," Even with all these variables under control, metal corrosion in the salt pool is very likely"
919,13,10, Additional methods of corrosion protection should be used to avoid problems
919,13,11, What is a Sacrificial Anode
919,13,12, A sacrificial metal anode is used to protect critical metal components in a salt system swimming pool
919,13,13, The sacrificial anode is connected electrically (either through direct contact or by use of a wire) to the metal to be protected
919,13,14," In a salt system pool, for example, a pool heater core will normally tend to corrode as a result of being in contact with the pool water"
919,13,15," If this heater core is connected to a properly designed sacrificial anode, the anode will tend to corrode and transfer electrons to the heater core"
919,13,16, At the interface between the pool water and heater core these electrons will create a chemical reaction that protects the heater core
919,13,17, The heater core (cathode) attracts electrons produced by the corroding sacrificial anode
919,13,18, The electrons react at the surface of the heater core with elements in the water
919,13,19, This reaction protects the heater core at the expense of the sacrificial anode
919,13,20, This transfer of electrons from the sacrificial anode to the metal to be protected is referred to as Cathodic protection
919,13,21, Examples of Sacrificial Anodes
919,13,22, All water heaters utilize sacrificial anodes to protect their steel tanks from corroding
919,13,23, The single most important factor in whether a water heater lives or dies is the condition of its sacrificial anode
919,13,24, Ships have anodes installed on their hulls to protect the steel hull from corroding in sea water
919,13,25, Lobster traps utilize sacrificial anodes to prevent corrosion on the ocean floor
919,13,26," Off shore oil rigs, buried pipelines, storage tanks, steel piers, and oil wells all utilize sacrificial anodes to prevent corrosion and premature failure of their critical components"
919,13,27, Why use TechNodes
919,13,28, TechNodes are the result of research done by Scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology
919,13,29, TechNodes are sacrificial anodes designed specifically to protect critical metal components in Salt System Swimming Pools
919,13,30," TechNode In-line is designed to protect any metal components in the pools plumbing, including pool heaters and heat exchangers"
919,13,31, Tech Node Ladder will protect pool ladders that are submerged in the swimming pool
919,13,32, Tech Node Light will prevent corrosion of metal components on underwater lights
919,13,33, TechNode Utility is designed to protect any other metal components in the swimming pool
919,13,34," TechNodes are cast from Mil Spec Zinc, have high surface area to volume characteristics resulting in the most efficient Pool Anodes on the market"

921,4,26," SPIN-CASTING Spin-casting is a prototype and short run zinc alloy casting process that enables engineers to review their designs, debug them, and proceed into production with confidence"
921,4,27," The spin-casting process uses high temperature, vulcanized silicone rubber molds and centrifugal force to produce highly detailed, low porosity, medium density castings"
921,4,28, The finished physical properties achieved using this process are the closest to die-cast properties available
921,4,29,  Spin-casting is an essential prototyping process for troubleshooting your engineering designs prior to investing in hard tooling
921,4,30,  It is also cost effective for low volume production requirements
921,4,31," As 4-slide simulation is standard, almost any die-casting design is suitable for spin-casting"
921,4,32," ​ Spin-casting is the least expensive, fastest prototyping process available for zinc alloy parts"
921,4,33, It also produces the very best representation of a finished die-cast part
921,4,34, Ideal quantities are fewer than 10 up to several thousand

969,1,2, You may also opt for brass or chrome-plated finishes if you think style and durability are what’s most important
969,1,3," We Use Computer Numerical Control Machining During our years in business, we have turned to Computer Numerical Control or CNC machining, a process where pre-programmed computer software dictates the movement of machinery"
969,1,4, This method makes it easier for us to produce the metal castings and parts needed by our clients to support their operations and supply chains
969,1,5," The Value of CNC Machining CNC machining helps us churn out high-quality and consistent metal parts, which increases our work efficiencies while also decreasing waste"

969,1,11, cold chamber die casting and hot chamber die casting
969,1,12," Although similar in many ways, they differ mainly in their heating processes"
969,1,13," The hot chamber requires the metal to be heated in the machine, whereas the cold chamber requires the metal to be heated in a separate furnace before transferring it to the casting machine"
969,1,14,"  In hot chamber casting, the raw materials are heated by the furnace"
969,1,15, A plunger then forces the metals through a gooseneck line into the die cavity of the mold
969,1,16," The moving half of the mold retracts from the fixed half, while the finished product is removed from the mold by the ejector pins"
969,1,17, The mold halves are then made ready for the next batch of molten metal to be injected
969,1,18,"  For cold chamber die casting, the raw material is poured from a ladle into the cold chamber"
969,1,19, A plunger advances to push the liquid metal into the die cavity
969,1,20, The fixed half remains in place while the moving half of the cavity retracts
969,1,21," Ejector pins in the moving half remove the finished product, and the mold halves are cleaned and made ready for the next production round"

990,4,0,"A Women’s Health Company Case Study Background In September 2014, Amato and Partners began an IR program for a private VC-backed women’s health company through a reverse merger, private placement, up-listing, and growth stage capital raises"
990,4,1," Around this time, Amato also began to develop research interest and coverage on the company"
990,4,2," Capital Markets Visibility As the company was listed in the OTC, our primary objective was to provide aftermarket support to increase the trading/liquidity of the stock"
990,4,3, This was accomplished in part by setting up one-on-one meetings with retail brokers and individual investors to increase awareness of the company’s story in the investment community
990,4,4, Another key component of gaining visibility was securing invitations for the company’s management to present at industry conferences in order to create awareness among retail and institutional investors
990,4,5," We coordinated non-deal roadshows with high net worth investors, family offices and small institutions interested in the company’s technology"
990,4,6," To enhance the company’s profile, we created collateral materials, including an investor presentation deck and a corporate fact sheet, and provided press release development and distribution to our database of members of the Wall Street community"
990,4,7, Early Funding Amato and Partners helped advise the company on an investment banking syndicate for two private placements with boutique banks of $12 million and $6 million
990,4,8, These capital raises were able to add institutional investors to supplement the existing VC funding
990,4,9, The capital raised was used to help fund clinical studies of the company’s device for the FDA and commercialization in OUS markets
990,4,10, Gaining sell-side research is an essential element of any strong investor relations program
990,4,11," Through our extensive contacts in the capital markets, we were able to gain sell-side research for the company"
990,4,12, This was an important step in providing visibility for the company to both institutional and retail investors
990,4,13, Up-listing Amato and Partners advised the company on a strategy to up-list to a senior exchange
990,4,14,"  Utilizing our contacts, we introduced the company to both senior exchanges, NYSEMKT and NASDAQCM"
990,4,15," In preparation for an up-listing, we advised the company on the appropriate size for a reverse stock split in order to retain enough shares in the public float"
990,4,16, We helped introduce the company to additional investment banks which were able to complete a $15
990,4,17,5 million oversubscribed underwritten offering in conjunction with the up-listing to the Nasdaq
990,4,18,"  The company also gained additional research coverage, with two new analysts initiating coverage"
990,4,19," Growth Capital – Commercialization and Clinical Studies Continuing our strategic IR approach, we introduced the company to larger, higher profile investment banks to cultivate interest"
990,4,20,"  With two, tier 2 investment banks, the company completed a $31"
990,4,21,"7 million straight equity raise, with no warrants"
990,4,22, This capital raise brought in quality retail ownership and further institutional ownership
990,4,23," In the beginning of 2018, this syndication of banks we had helped put together completed an additional $30 million equity raise"
990,4,24," Summary Through our full range of IR services, we took the company from zero trading volume to over 500,000/shares a day"

990,5,0,"A Pharmaceutical Oncology Company Case Study Background Amato and Partners, with years of experience in the capital markets, advised a client through a turbulent early stage, and positioned it for growth"
990,5,1," A pharmaceutical company with a clinical-stage cancer drug, the company went public through a reverse merger in March of 2013"
990,5,2, The company raised $10
990,5,3,5 million by selling a unit consisting of 1 common share and 1 warrant
990,5,4," Shortly after the transaction, the broker/dealer who underwrote the deal went out of business"
990,5,5, The stock price was approximately $1
990,5,6,"70 per share and daily volume was less than 10,000 shares"
990,5,7," Capital Markets Visibility A newly public company with low trading volume, our primary objective was to increase the trading/liquidity of the stock"
990,5,8," We accomplished this goal by setting up meetings with retail brokers and individual investors, as well as coordinating nationwide non-deal roadshows with family offices and special situation funds"
990,5,9," We were able to secure invitations for company management to present at non-paid industry conferences, increasing visibility among retail and institutional investors and analysts, who had the opportunity to meet with management and hear the company story"
990,5,10, The start of sell-side research coverage to date has been an objective we achieved for our client
990,5,11, We continue to be proactive in cultivating relationships with both buy- and sell-side analysts
990,5,12," this includes setting up one-on-one meetings, conference calls and ongoing communication of the company’s progress"
990,5,13, Amato and Partners also created collateral materials geared toward the public markets
990,5,14," this included an investor presentation deck and a corporate fact sheet, as well as the investor relations section of the company website"
990,5,15," As part of our continuing communication, we field investor inquiries and disseminate company news to our client-specific database of investors"
990,5,16," Coordinating Broker/Dealer Sponsorship As with any reverse-merger company, trading volume and liquidity is a challenge in the early stages"
990,5,17," For this client, it was exacerbated by the closing of the underwriting broker/dealer"
990,5,18, Amato and Partners – through its extensive network in the investment banking community – was able to help secure a new broker/dealer relationship that enabled the company’s original investing shareholders to shift their position to the new broker/dealer
990,5,19," Capital Structure Approach The company had warrants as part of its original offering, creating a derivative liability on their balance sheet and a barrier to up-listing to a senior exchange"
990,5,20, In the summer of 2014 the company executed a warrant tender offer
990,5,21, The company was able to decrease the derivative liability and raise $2
990,5,22,4 million in non-dilutive capital
990,5,23, We advised the company on the strategic effects the tender offer would have on the capital markets
990,5,24, Current Status We continue to raise the visibility and profile of the company and help them achieve future IR milestones
990,5,25," The company’s current market cap is approximately $30 million, and over 35,000 of its shares are traded daily"

1038,2,2, An easier way of fitting flanged equipment is always welcome
1038,2,3," The CTS Copper Companion Flange, a fully floating flange, is such a logical development in copper tube installation that it is hard to believe that no one has thought of it before"
1038,2,4, The concept is very simple
1038,2,5,"  Instead of having to install a brass companion flange that requires careful alignment of bolt holes during brazing, the CTS Copper Companion Flange uses a copper fitting brazed/soldered directly to the copper tube, backed by a fully floating powder coated steel flange fitted with a neoprene insulator"
1038,2,6,  The integral insulator allows the CTS flange to offer 100% protection against electrolysis
1038,2,7, The system has many advantages

1056,19,4," The main erection crane for the towers was the “Vivian”, one of Surespan Wind’s new LG1750"
1056,19,5, We also used many RT and AT cranes from various suppliers
1056,19,6, There was an average of 300 Surespan workers on-site throughout project construction beginning in July and approximately 500 workers during peak construction periods
1056,19,7," The weather in June was so extreme with heavy rains and the resulting mud, which meant that rain mats were required to support the cranes and protect the ground"
1056,19,8, Over the winter months temperatures fell to 40 below and worse
1056,19,9, We had to start reducing capacities after about 34 below and motors and hydraulics were our biggest challenges
1056,19,10, Our equipment has winter backup systems with pre-heaters etc
1056,19,11, so that we can carry on and be as productive as possible during the cold months
1056,19,12, High winds blowing the snow in the fields would shut down even snowplows
1056,19,13, Lack of visibility would also shut us down
1056,19,14, But once the wind stops we come in and dig ourselves out and carry on working again

1056,24,4," At the maximum generating capacity, the Summerhaven Wind Energy Centre produces enough energy for approximately 32,000 homes"
1056,24,5," Siemens, as the manufacturer of the turbines on this project, was responsible for having a representative on site who supervised the contractor as they installed the turbines to ensure correct installation and to identify any potential issues"
1056,24,6, Siemens didn’t have enough of these Technical Field Advisors so they hired Surespan due to our technicians’ experience with Siemens turbines
1056,24,7,  We had half a dozen advisors onsite for the length of the project as representatives of Siemens
1056,24,8, Challenges Overcome
1056,24,9, The Summerhaven site was in very good shape and there was no wind

1056,25,4," It is the world’s first and only wind turbine that allows visitors to stand in a clear glass viewPOD at the top of the tower, three metres from its massive, rotating blades"
1056,25,5, Surespan’s part of the project began in late September of 2009
1056,25,6, It took longer to get the crane up and down the mountain than it did to erect the turbine
1056,25,7, Transportation was provided by Surespan’s off highway lowbed and we used our LR1280 with 190’main boom and 90′ lugging jib which was reduced to 80′ for the generator lift
1056,25,8, Challenges Overcome
1056,25,9, The unique aspects of this project included mobilizing to the peak of Grouse Mountain up a winding narrow old mountain road
1056,25,10, Staging by the Grouse Mountain Grizzly Bear Den and very limited room at site
1056,25,11, The boom was assembled in the air because of a huge dip in the surrounding area

1056,26,4, The project began in March 2014 and completed in June of 2014
1056,26,5, Challenges Overcome
1056,26,6, We were able to help create positive teamwork with other sub-contractors involved in the project and bring the group together to hit the required marks for the general contractor
1056,26,7, Later in the project we had to run the LG 1750 crane 24 hours a day with two full crews in order to meet deadlines
1056,26,8," With this operation, we were able to bring up almost one turbine per day"
1056,26,9," Our LG 1750 crane is able to work non-stop because it’s thoroughly maintained so that it’s perfectly reliable, which eliminates the need to spend any time on repairs during projects"
1056,26,10," Due to our years of experience, we have grown in our capacity to be more creative with how to complete projects"

1086,2,0,"About Hammond & Irving, Inc"
1086,2,1," Hammond & Irving, Inc"
1086,2,2,was founded by Charles Hammond and Robert Irving in 1919
1086,2,3, The combination of this expert hammersman and owner of a mill supply business allowed H&I to immediately supply quality forged products to a strong local customer base
1086,2,4, H&I broke from the tradition of serving only local needs in the early 1920s
1086,2,5," As the company continued to expand, larger capacity hammers were acquired to facilitate our entrance into new markets"
1086,2,6, This expansion from a few small steam hammers to nine hammers that covered a wide range of sizes and shapes ensured the company continued success during the depression
1086,2,7, H&I invested in a unique piece of equipment in the late 60s which revolutionized its manufacturing process
1086,2,8," The original ring roller gave H&I the advantage of producing rings at a faster speed, and was able to change measurements (set-up) in a matter of minutes rather than what previously took hours or even days"
1086,2,9, During the 70s and 80s two hydraulic presses were acquired to replace our large hammers
1086,2,10," However, we still maintain ""small"" hammer equipment and are capable of producing the finest hammered product available in the market"
1086,2,11, In the spring of 1999 H&I continued its investment into the future through the purchase of a Wagner 63/63 RAW ring roller and support equipment
1086,2,12," Many pieces of equipment throughout the facility were upgraded, and product flow was greatly improved"
1086,2,13, This state-of-the art piece of equipment allows H&I to manufacture a superior rolled ring with greater accuracy and improved consistency
1086,2,14, For the last several years H&I has remained on the path of continuous improvement by investing in the company
1086,2,15, Much of our manufacturing equipment has been upgraded with improved controls
1086,2,16, New equipment has been added to the facility
1086,2,17, Our employees have been continuously trained and we are registered to the latest standards of the ISO 9001 Standard
1086,2,18, In 2009 the company completed a major addition to the heat treat and shipping departments
1086,2,19, This project allows us to meet the delivery requirements of our customers

1128,5,0,The CT Scan Gets Spooky Home»The CT Scan Gets Spooky Have you ever seen the inside of a pumpkin
1128,5,1," Of course, you have"
1128,5,2, Every Halloween people slice open pumpkins and remove the innards which creates a perfect viewing angle for which to see inside
1128,5,3," But, what if I told you it was possible to look inside a pumpkin without having to cut into it"
1128,5,4," No, this is not some sort of black magic, but the power of science"
1128,5,5," With the advancement in technology, this very thing has become a reality"
1128,5,6, That technology is called CT Scanning
1128,5,7, Non-destructive CT scanning has a number of different applications
1128,5,8," Here at Castem, the applications we use the most are dimensional inspection, defect analysis, reverse engineering, and archiving"
1128,5,9, Today’s scan showcases all these except dimensional inspection
1128,5,10," Using our Nikon MCT225 machine, we’ve taken a dive into everyone’s favorite (or overdone) squash, as well as a traditional gourd"
1128,5,11," Thanks to the machine’s micro-focus high resolution, we have explored the internal geometries of the spooky veggie down to microns without even touching it"
1128,5,12, The scanner takes thousands of X-ray images in 360 degrees around the object and reconstructs them into a full 3D image
1128,5,13," To see what we mean, take a look below"
1128,5,14," This is an example of archiving, as the original pumpkin has long since rotted away, but it remains here, in our computer drives"
1128,5,15," (Click or tap on the images for greater detail)  Using this non-destructive process, you can take a look inside without the need to cut it open"
1128,5,16," Below, you can see a cross-sectional image anywhere desired on the X, Y, and Z axes within the object"
1128,5,17, To those of you who have carved a pumpkin before – does this look familiar to you
1128,5,18, One of the biggest strengths of CT Scanning is that you can actually use the data from the scan to extract specific internal parts of the object
1128,5,19, Here we’ve isolated two seeds from the gourd and highlighted them
1128,5,20," Actually, many seeds"
1128,5,21," If you’re ever trying to play those guessing games where you need to estimate how many candies or objects are in a jar, then CT scanning is the solution for you"
1128,5,22," Take a guess of how many are in the gourd, and we’ll tell you at the end of the article if you were right"
1128,5,23,"   In fact, the detail is so great we can actually 3D print one of these seeds without ever looking at it"
1128,5,24," As you might expect, each seed is only about 10 millimeters long, or 3/8ths of an inch for Americans"
1128,5,25," This may be a slightly unconventional use-case, but it’s a good example of reverse engineering, the second of our CT uses"
1128,5,26,  Or the air pockets inside the pumpkin flesh
1128,5,27, Looking at air pockets in this way is actually akin to looking for voids or other internal defects in molds and other metal parts
1128,5,28,"  And while this whole post may not be the most useful to you readers at home, I hope this has captured your interest inscanning a rotting pumpkin to see what rot looks like on the insidethe possibilities of CT scanning"
1128,5,29," Well, feeling spooky yet"
1128,5,30, Who knew squash hid so many secrets
1128,5,31," Maybe now you want to make a mask out of squash innards, just wrinkly seeds, and fibers"
1128,5,32, It’s sure to freak someone out

1142,1,0,"Magnetic Materials Rare Earth Magnets  High Performance Magnets Alnico Magnets - High Performance The most common magnetic materials in use today are alnico, ceramic (hard ferrites), samarium cobalt, and neodymium"
1142,1,1,  Each are made up of different elements used for different applications
1142,1,2, Short Timeline of Modern Permanent Magnets A big step in the evolution of the permanent magnet materials used today came in the 1930’s with the development of Alnico magnets
1142,1,3," In 1931, T"
1142,1,4," Mishima discovered that an alloy of iron, nickel, aluminum had a much higher coercivity than the best steel magnets of the time"
1142,1,5," Further research created alnico, a term referring to a series of permanent magnet alloys which in addition to iron are composed primarily of aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co)"
1142,1,6, Various alnico grades with differing magnetic properties can be achieved by modifying the chemistry and manufacturing process
1142,1,7," Today’s composition of alnico alloys is typically 8–12% Al, 15–26% Ni, 5–24% Co, up to 6% Cu, up to 1% Ti, with the balance being Fe"
1142,1,8," In addition to varying the alloy composition, specialized casting techniques can be used to achieve unique crystalline grain orientation"
1142,1,9, Examples of this are alnico 5-7 and 9
1142,1,10," Once magnetized, Alnico magnets have between 5 and 17 times the magnetic force of magnetite or lodestone, a naturally occurring magnet which can attract iron"
1142,1,11," Alnico magnets have the benefit of having the lowest temperature coefficient, or temperature stability of all of the permanent magnet materials"
1142,1,12," Plus, they can be calibrated and have high residual induction"
1142,1,13,"Before the development of rare earth magnets in the 1970’s, alnico was the strongest type of permanent magnet"
1142,1,14," Since that time, many applications using alnico have replaced it with less expensive or more powerful types of magnets"
1142,1,15," However, the fact that alnico can be used in very high temperatures (up to 930°F or 500°C) make them indispensable in certain applications"
1142,1,16, Alnico magnets are also ideal for corrosive applications and are commonly used for various types of sensors
1142,1,17," They are stronger than ceramic magnets, but not as strong as rare-earth magnets"
1142,1,18, Manufacturing Processes
1142,1,19, Alnico magnets are manufactured either by casting or sintering
1142,1,20," Most alnico produced is anisotropic, meaning that the magnetic direction of the grains is oriented in one direction"
1142,1,21,  This orientation is achieved via heat treatment after casting or sintering
1142,1,22,  The process involves heating the cast or sintered part above its Curie temperature and then cooling it at a controlled rate in the presence of a strong directional magnetic field
1142,1,23,  Final shaping of the alnico materials is achieved by abrasive grinding and cutting where close tolerances are required
1142,1,24, Properties
1142,1,25," Hard Ferrites Ceramic magnets, like the ones used in refrigerator magnets and elementary-school science experiments, contain iron oxide in a ceramic composite"
1142,1,26,"  Most ceramic magnets, sometimes known as ferrite magnets, aren’t particularly strong"
1142,1,27, Ceramic permanent magnets are made from finely powdered barium ferrite or strontium ferrite formed under heat and pressure
1142,1,28,  Their magnetic strength is enhanced by aligning the powder particles with a strong magnetic field during forming
1142,1,29,  Ceramic magnets are somewhat comparable to alnico magnets in terms of magnetic force and have the advantage of being able to be pressed into various shapes without significant machining
1142,1,30,"  However, hard ferrites are not magnetically stable at higher temperatures"
1142,1,31,"  They are typically used in magnets where price is a primary driver, rather than size or mass"
1142,1,32, Advantages
1142,1,33, Disadvantages
1142,1,34," Samarium Cobalt Magnets In the 1970s, researchers developed permanent magnets made from powdered samarium cobalt fused under heat"
1142,1,35,  Samarium cobalt magnets can be made to produce magnetic fields 50 times stronger than magnetite
1142,1,36,"  Samarium cobalt magnets can operate in higher temperatures, but cannot be calibrated"
1142,1,37," Samarium cobalt magnets are made mostly from samarium and cobalt, with small amounts of other elements such as iron, copper, zirconium and hafnium"
1142,1,38,  The majority of the material is cobalt
1142,1,39,  They are typically used in higher temperature applications where the strength of rare earth magnets is still needed
1142,1,40,"  They have a higher Curie temperature than NdFeB, but are also more expensive to manufacture"
1142,1,41, Neodymium Iron Boron Magnets The newest permanent magnet material was developed in the 1980s using powdered neodymium iron boron (NdFeB)
1142,1,42,  This type of magnetic material produces magnetic forces almost 75 times stronger than magnetite
1142,1,43,  These are the most powerful permanent magnets commercially available today
1142,1,44," Neodymium magnets are made up of neodymium, iron and boron, with the majority being iron"

1181,14,0,What Are Lifting Magnets Made Of
1181,14,1, What kinds of materials are used in making magnets
1181,14,2, How do we select the magnets that power lifting magnets such as our Magnetic SpecialtiesModel 1037
1181,14,3," It takes a lot more power to lift 2,500 pounds of steel plate than can be found in a steel or iron compass needle, that’s for sure"
1181,14,4, Magnetic materials used these days fall into four groups
1181,14,5," Alnico, Ceramic (Ferrite), Samarium-Cobalt, and Neodymium"
1181,14,6," Each has its own characteristics, advantages and disadvantages"
1181,14,7," Alnicomagnets are made from iron alloyed primarily with aluminum, nickel, and cobalt, thus the name, though they can also include copper or titanium, and these magnets have been around since the 1930s"
1181,14,8,"While not the strongest magnets when compared to rare earth magnets, they have the highest range of operating temperatures"
1181,14,9," As temperature increases, magnets begin to lose strength, and when the temperature reaches theCurie temperaturefor that magnetic material, they lose all magnetization and become useless as magnets until remagnetized"
1181,14,10," The Curie temperatures for Alnico magnets are the highest, in the range of 800° C and with a maximum normal operating temperature in the range of 500° C"
1181,14,11," Depending on the exact Alnico alloy, Alnico magnets can be isotropic, able to be magnetized in any direction, while others are anositropic, having a preferred direction of magnetization"
1181,14,12," They are less resistant to corrosion than the rare earth magnets, but not so much as the ferrites"
1181,14,13," Though the oldest of the four categories of magnets listed above, their combination of strength and thermal characteristics makes them still relevant today, and they are used in such areas as the manufacture of guitar pickups, electric motors, microphones, sensors, and loudspeakers"
1181,14,14," Ceramicmagnets (Ferritemagnets) were also originally developed in the 1930s, with technological advances increasing their magnetic strength to the levels we see today"
1181,14,15," They are made from iron (III) oxide mixed with other elements such as strontium, barium, manganese, nickel, or zinc, and are strong, very resistant to corrosion, retain their magnetism very well, and economical of cost"
1181,14,16," This combination of factors makes ceramic magnets the magnet of choice for applications such ourModel 1057lifting magnet, able to lift up to 2500 pounds of steel plate, as well as for magnetic sign capping with ourMagna Caps"
1181,14,17," Unusually compared to other ferromagnetic materials, ferrite magnets are not conductors of electricity"
1181,14,18," They have a good operating temperature range, though with a Curie temperature in the range of 450° C not to the level of Alnico magnets"
1181,14,19," Due to the combination of cost and power, ceramic magnets see wide applications industrially in lifting and separating, and because of their lack of electrical conductivity, find use in transformers and even electromagnets to control eddy current losses"
1181,14,20," The core memory of early computers was made with ferrite cores, and ferrite particles and powder are even used in magnetic recording tape as well as in radar-absorbing stealth technology"
1181,14,21," Neodymiummagnets are the magnets people usually mean when they speak of rare earth magnets, though there are actually 17 rare earth elements, and samarium-cobalt magnets are also rare earth magnets"
1181,14,22," They have the highest strength for their size, of all the types of magnets you can buy today, which makes them the choice when power is the only consideration, but they have significant disadvantages as well"
1181,14,23," They were discovered in the 1980s independently by General Motors and by Sumitomo Special Metals and are available in several grades of strength, from N28 to N52 (the strongest)"
1181,14,24," All are anisotropic, strongly having a preferred direction of magnetization and difficult to magnetize in other directions"
1181,14,25, They tend to be vulnerable to corrosion and are thus often covered with a protective coat
1181,14,26," Neodymium magnets are very costly, and not generally suitable for high-temperature applications due to their lowish Curie temperatures, in the 300-400° C range"
1181,14,27," Even with these disadvantages however they find wide usage, in applications from electric motors and computer hard drives to magnetic bearings and loudspeakers"
1181,14,28," Samarium-Cobaltmagnets are our final class of magnets, and they, like neodymium magnets, belong to the category of rare earth magnets"
1181,14,29," Like neodymium magnets they are quite strong, though not quite so much so as the neodymium"
1181,14,30," When you add in the fact that they are also brittle, like neodymium magnets, but are even more costly, you might think that there is no reason for using them, but they do have one large advantage over neodymium, and that is the operating range of temperatures, with Curie temperatures in the range of 700-800° C, about twice as high as for neodymium"
1181,14,31," AtMagnetic Specialties, we have dealt with all of these from the ceramic magnets utilized in ourModel 1037, 1037jr,and otherlifting magnets, to custom-designed neodymium applications"
1181,14,32," For smaller parts-handling solutions, try ourModel 790hand magnet"

1191,1,0,Open The Door Products About us The Founder ofOpen The Door Productshas over 50 years of experience in the custom cabinetry industry
1191,1,1, We sincerely believe that life is about relationships
1191,1,2," the better our relationships, the better our lives"
1191,1,3," It is our goal to create relationships of the highest integrity with our suppliers, employees, distributors, cabinet shops, and the end users"
1191,1,4,  Our Purpose Our purpose is to fulfill a 40 plus year need for a better magnetic catch
1191,1,5," Most magnetic catches are noisy, hard to open, and cheap-looking on high-quality cabinetry"
1191,1,6," All other types of latches such as ball catches, roller catches and turn latches require that you push and follow the door until it is completely closed"
1191,1,7," Spring-loaded hinges were developed to solve this problem, but they fall short of filling all the requirements of inset cabinetry because an adjustable door stop is still needed"
1191,1,8,"  Many “purist” designers prefer the appearance of an exposed “butt-type” hinge, which opens 180 degrees rather than the 110/120 degrees of a concealed euro hinge"
1191,1,9, Another need in the high-end custom cabinet industry is a way of preventing warped doors
1191,1,10," Our catch employs two high-strength, high-grade permanent neodymium magnets with enough force to pull in mildly warped doors"
1191,1,11," It also stands to reason that if a magnet can pull in warped doors, the constant force will help to prevent most doors from warping in the future"
1191,1,12," We have even seen our magnets pull in non-warped doors to compensate for improperly installed cabinets that are ""racked"""
1191,1,13, How valuable is the warped door prevention to you
1191,1,14, Consider how much it costs to replace a door
1191,1,15," How nearly impossible it is to produce a new door that matches well because it is probably not made from the same batch of wood, possibly made and finished by different people, and will not have the same amount of aging"
1191,1,16," This benefit alone could nearly offset the difference in the cost of the soft close magnetic catches and you also have the advantage of quiet, soft-closing and easy to open action, which is a great sales advantage for your product"

1191,3,4,2969 oropenthedoor@frontier
1191,3,5,com Where can we buy the products
1191,3,6, SeeContactus What wood species are available
1191,3,7," Inventoried wood species are maple, cherry, walnut, red oak, white oak, and mahogany"
1191,3,8, other species are available by special order
1191,3,9, Why do you use wooden mounting bases
1191,3,10," Die cast metal and plastic-mounting bases are available on the market, however they are too low-profile to work properly on inset cabinetry"
1191,3,11, The corresponding door magnet is too close to the edge of the door
1191,3,12, Another reason is that they do not provide the adjustability that is needed with most cabinetry
1191,3,13, A third reason is that a mounting base made of wood that matches the cabinet interior will visually blend in and be less noticeable
1191,3,14, These units are designed first for great function and then to blend in with the cabinet interior
1191,3,15, What makes these closers so quiet
1191,3,16, We use two precisely tuned magnets to draw the door closed in combination with a shock absorber to keep the door from slamming or bouncing open
1191,3,17," Additionally, we do not allow the magnets to make contact by separating them with a soft, pyramid-shaped neoprene bumper"
1191,3,18, What type of magnets are used
1191,3,19," The Neodymium, rare earth, magnets are made to our specific ""tuned"" size, strength and grade"
1191,3,20, They are permanent magnets tested to lose less than 5% of their strength of 10 years
1191,3,21, How can your magnets be strong enough to pull in warped doors and still be easy to open
1191,3,22, Most magnets are rated by theirholdingforce
1191,3,23," To create ease of opening, we do not allow the two magnets to make contact by applying a pyramid-shaped, soft neoprene bumper between them"
1191,3,24," This also makes them very quiet, but creates the need for fine tuning the strength and grade of the magnets to off-set the resistance of the shock absorber"
1191,3,25, Can the wood mounting bases be finished to match cabinet interiors
1191,3,26," Yes, you can paint over the existing natural finish (after removing the shock), or by ordering unfinished units in maple, cherry, walnut, red oak, white oak, and mahogany"
1191,3,27, Other wood species are available by special order with longer lead times and a minimum order
1191,3,28, Do mounting bases have to be disassembled to finish
1191,3,29, Only the shock must be removed because application of finish will likely inhibit it's function
1191,3,30, It is important that you do not apply an excessive amount of finish to the inside of the bore for the shock because it may cause the block to split when reinserting the shock
1191,3,31, you can paint or varnish over the magnet without affecting it's function
1191,3,32, What keeps the magnets in the mounting base and the cabinet door
1191,3,33, We use a pin that is pressed through the wood and a hole in the magnet to keep the magnet in the block
1191,3,34," Using the pin for mounting makes it possible to reverse the magnet polarity, if necessary"
1191,3,35," The corresponding door magnet fits tightly into a properly drilled hole, however we know that wood will dry out and this magnet could come loose"
1191,3,36, To prevent this possibility we use a screw mount door magnet
1191,3,37, Refer to theProductssection for a picture
1191,3,38, What type of shock absorber do you use and why
1191,3,39, We use an Italian-made shock by Salice because they are available in different strengths and the one that we use works best at dampening the drawing force of the magnets and preventing bounce if the door is slammed
1191,3,40," Other shocks on the market are self-adjusting, which does not work as well for our particular purpose"
1191,3,41, How difficult are your catches to install
1191,3,42, There is very little difference from installing a standard magnet with a metal plate
1191,3,43," there are two screws in the mounting base and one hole to drill in the cabinet door for the magnet to be glued in, The final step is application of the soft, pyramid-shaped bumper, which is self-adhesive"
1191,3,44, We recommend a placement jig and C-clamp for consistent mounting of the blocks in the cabinet and a drill press with a jig for consistent drilling of door magnet holes for high production efficiency
1191,3,45, What happens if my cabinet floor is not flush with the inside edge of my face frame
1191,3,46," There will be no problem if the floor is very, nearly flush (i"
1191,3,47,e
1191,3,48," within 1/32"" to 1/16"") with the inside of the face frame"
1191,3,49, The problem that can occur is the magnet in the door will become very close to the edge of the door
1191,3,50, This may create the need to shim the mounting base or request a higher mounting base made for your situation
1191,3,51, What height blocks are kept in stock for quick delivery
1191,3,52," The soft-close mounting blocks standard height is 3/4"""
1191,3,53, These are available in all of our normal wood species
1191,3,54," We now stock 7/8"" high blocks in maple, cherry, and walnut"
1191,3,55, These are used when cabinets are constructed with floors held down from the edge of the face frame so that the floor can be machined into the face frame
1191,3,56, Refer to theProductspage to see these blocks
1191,3,57, Can we get custom-sized mounting blocks
1191,3,58," Yes, in situations such as floors that are not flush with the top edge of the face frame you may need a higher block"
1191,3,59," These can be produced, but with longer lead times and minimum order quantities"
1191,3,60, What color door shocks are available
1191,3,61, Honey-colored shocks are standard
1191,3,62," White shocks are available, if requested only, when ordering unfinished maple blocks"
1191,3,63, The white shocks are ideal when cabinets are being painted to match light-colored painted interiors
1191,3,64, How long does it take for delivery
1191,3,65," We maintain a considerable inventory of all items shown in the ""Products"" section"
1191,3,66," Thus, we will normally ship via FedEx within one day of your order"
1191,3,67," Large or custom orders may take four to five weeks to produce, so we recommend that you order units when your project is sold rather than wait until the day you need them"

1216,0,19,  ISO 9001 Certified Anodes 
1216,1,0,Anodes  A galvanic anode is the main component of a galvanic Cathodic Protection (CP) system used to protect buried or submerged metal structures from corrosion
1216,1,1," They are made from a metal alloy with a more ""active"" voltage (more negative electrochemical potential) than the metal of the structure"
1216,1,2," The difference in potential between the two metals means that the galvanic an ode corrodes, so that the anode material is consumed in preference to the structure"
1216,1,3, The loss (or sacrifice) of the anode material gives rise to the alternative name of sacrificial anode
1216,1,4," Anode Materials There are three main alloys used as galvanic anodes, magnesium, aluminum and zinc"
1216,1,5," They are all available as blocks, rods, plates or extruded ribbon"
1216,1,6, Each material has advantages and disadvantages
1216,1,7, Aluminum Aluminum anodes have several advantages
1216,1,8," they are much lighter in weight, and have a much higher capacity than zinc"
1216,1,9, Their electrochemical behavior is not considered as reliable as zinc and greater care must be taken in how they are used
1216,1,10," When aluminum strikes a rusty surface a large thermite spark may be generated, so its use is restricted in tanks where there may be explosive atmospheres and there is a risk of the anode falling"
1216,1,11, Read more about ourAluminum Anodes
1216,1,12," Zinc Zinc is considered a reliable material but is not suitable for use at higher temperatures as it tends to passivate (it becomes less negative - if this happens, current may cease to flow and the anode stops working)"
1216,1,13,"It has a relatively low driving voltage, which means in higher resistivity soils or water it may not be able to provide sufficient current"
1216,1,14," However, in some circumstances, where there is a risk of hydrogen embrittlement for example, the low driving voltage is an advantage since overprotection is avoided"
1216,1,15, Read more about ourZinc Anodes
1216,1,16, Magnesium Magnesium has the most negative electropotential of the three (see Galvanic series) and is more suitable for areas where the electrolyte (soil or water) resistivity is higher
1216,1,17," This is usually on-shore pipelines and other buried structures, although it is also used on boats in fresh water and in water heaters"
1216,1,18," In some cases, the negative potential of magnesium can be a disadvantage"
1216,1,19," If the potential of the protected metal becomes too negative, hydrogen ions may be evolved on the cathode surface leading to hydrogen embrittlement or to disbonding of the coating , Where this is a possibility, zinc anodes may be used"
1216,1,20,  Read more about ourMagnesium Anodes
1216,1,21," Zinc and aluminum are generally used in salt water, where the resistivity is generally lower"
1216,1,22," Typical uses are for the hulls of ships and boats, offshore pipelines and production platforms, in salt-water cooled marine engines, on small boat propellers and rudders and for the internal surface of storage tanks"
1216,1,23," Since the operation of a galvanic anode relies on the difference in electropotential between the anode and the cathode, practically any metal can be used to protect any other, providing there is a sufficient difference in potential"
1216,1,24," For example, iron anodes can be used to protect copper"

1219,2,0, PROTOTYPE TO PRODUCTION Printed Sand Casting  We recently began offering sand castings using a printed sand mold process
1219,2,1, The process uses 3D Printer technology to print a sand mold directly onto a print bed
1219,2,2, This process eliminates the need for hard tooling
1219,2,3, The process also supports geometries that were once restricted to production investment casting
1219,2,4, Complex cores and undercuts are all easily achieved using this state-of-the-art system
1219,2,5, The process can produce a limited number of sand molds in as little as 5 days from receipt of an order
1219,2,6, Printed sand molds are appropriate for smaller quantities or for geometry that is not supportable using a traditional sand casting
1219,2,7," The surface finish and mechanical properties are consistent with traditional sand castings, while the tolerances are much closer to air-set sand casting tolerances"
1219,2,8, This process is an excellent choice for larger castings that are too large to print in a wax pattern system
1219,2,9," The printer is capable of making individual molds up to ~ 70” x 39” x 27”, as well as printing multiple simultaneous molds inside the print envelope"

1219,3,0," PROTOTYPE TO PRODUCTION Permanent Mold Casting  USING OUR IN-HOUSE TOOLING DEPARTMENT, WE CUT A HARD TOOL FROM EITHER STEEL, OR GRAPHITE"
1219,3,1,  The tooling can be single or multi-cavity depending on part size and quantity requirements
1219,3,2, Expected tool life can vary based on the tooling material and part geometry
1219,3,3," As the name implies, Permanent Mold casting eliminates the cost of single use molds"
1219,3,4, Permanent Mold casting is a often an economical option for customers needing parts that would typically be small to intermediate sand castings
1219,3,5," By eliminating the material and labor costs normally associated with sand casting, the casting costs can be made more affordable"
1219,3,6," Tooling for Permanent Mold casting is often less expensive than die casting since the metal is not under high pressure, and produces less stress on the tooling"
1219,3,7, Advantages
1219,3,8,Consistent geometry
1219,3,9, durable tooling can produce thousands of parts
1219,3,10, can rapidly produce hundreds of castings
1219,3,11, excellent option between sand casting and die casting
1219,3,12," For future work here together, we have recently purchased our own production Permanent Mold machine"
1219,3,13,  We wanted this process in house to help you our customer have a source for Prototypes & Production quantities
1219,3,14, We can then apply what we have learned together on your smaller run parts and then run full scale volumes together for years as you need
1219,3,15," We took this next step for our business because we continue to innovate, listen to you our customers and aim for sustainable growth to manufacture more here in the USA under our facility"
1219,3,16,"  As we get operational, we will market more than just the information on the machine and what it looks like it our Shop, but as you are a valued customer, we wanted you all aware"

1219,8,0, PROTOTYPE TO PRODUCTION History  Protocast Company History
1219,8,1," Protocast was founded in 1995 in a small 2000 sqft shop just north of Denver, Colorado by Mike Kaiser and Kevin Fortin"
1219,8,2, Protocast Inc
1219,8,3,", was founded on speed and 3D printing technology Protocast utilized the dba Prototype Castings as that was the business focus"
1219,8,4, 
1219,8,5," The tooling process that was used to create molds started with SLA’s, urethane and silicon tooling was created from the 3D pattern"
1219,8,6, These tools were used to create plaster molds
1219,8,7, Metal was then poured into the plaster mold to create the casting
1219,8,8, In 1998 Prototype Casting moved to a larger shop in Northglenn CO
1219,8,9, Protocast continued to grow and in 2000 moved to part of its current location in Denver
1219,8,10, Mike Kaiser retired in 2011 and sold the business to longtime employee Chad TeBeest
1219,8,11," Currently, Protocast occupies a total of 24,000 sqft"
1219,8,12, By 2012 the need to go into Production also coincided with a renewed focus on Protocast as the marketed name
1219,8,13,"  As time goes by and the business evolves, Protocast has aimed to stay in tune with its customers and their needs while keeping in alignment with our Vision and Mission Statement"
1219,8,14, Added processes as company grew and technologies evolved CNC Machining was added in 2002in response to customers request for complete parts verses just castings
1219,8,15, Larger capacity CNC machines have replaced the first machine as well as added capacity
1219,8,16," Currently Prototype Casting operates 10 CNC machines, we are capable of 5-axis operations and largest bed size of 60” by 120”"
1219,8,17, Sand casting was added in 2005with the addition of a Tinker Omega continuous sand mixer
1219,8,18," Sand casting is a great compliment to the RPM (Rubber Plaster Mold), process the company was founded on"
1219,8,19, Sand casting currently makes up about half of our foundry business
1219,8,20," Also in 2005, Prototype Casting began cutting tools from pattern board on CNC equipment"
1219,8,21,Thus replacing the tooling process the company was founded on
1219,8,22," With the advancement in speed of CNC machining, and the increased processing power of computers for CAM programming, the choice was easy"
1219,8,23," The tools that are now produced are created faster, cheaper, and are more accurate then tools made from 3D printed patterns"
1219,8,24, Investment Casting was added in 2008
1219,8,25,"The process is slightly different than the traditional investment process, in so that we never create a tool"
1219,8,26, All of the castings are produced directly from a 3D printed pattern
1219,8,27," This process works well for small, low volume, complex parts"
1219,8,28," This process is faster, cheaper, and provides an actual industry standard, fully dense casting when compared to DMLS (Direct metal laser sintering) In 2011, Mike Kaiser the co-founder soldProtocastto Chad TeBeest"
1219,8,29,"Chad, had worked for Protocast for 7 years at the time"
1219,8,30," Mike loved the business that he founded and enjoyed success with, but wanted to retire and travel the country in his RV"
1219,8,31," In November of 2012,just 11 short months after entering full retirement, Mike Kaiser passed away of pancreatic cancer"
1219,8,32, During his last few months Mike was very happy to see his dream continue to grow
1219,8,33," We will always remember Mike and many of his visions and directions, continue to guide Protocast"
1219,8,34," In 2013, Prototype Casting added the ability to heat treat castings in house"
1219,8,35, This increased the speed at which we could provide heat treated parts
1219,8,36," The process typically took 2-3 days before, now it can be done in most cases overnight"
1219,8,37," In 2014, Prototype Casting purchased a HAAS gantry style CNC mill for cutting tools"
1219,8,38,This over doubled our tool cutting capacity and allowed us to provide better lead times to our customers
1219,8,39," This machine also has a much larger bed (120”x60”) then our other CNC mills, thus increasing the size of tools that we can produce"
1219,8,40," In 2015, Prototype Casting greatly expanded the sand casting linewith the addition of a larger continuous sand mixer with dual hopper, automated controls, and mechanical reclaim"
1219,8,41," This allows Prototype Casting to move from just low quantity high quality to production quantities, while still maintaining the high quality demanded by the market place"
1219,8,42," The investment also represents the commitment of Prototype Casting to minimize its footprint for consuming natural resources, specifically the silica sand used in sand casting"
1219,8,43," Because of secondary markets for reclaimed sand, and the ability to reuse 80% of the sand in the process, the waste of sand to landfills will be completely eliminated"
1219,8,44," In Spring of 2017, we moved"
1219,8,45,"Good afternoon, I hope you are doing well today"
1219,8,46,  It’s been a little while since our last correspondence and I wanted to check in and say hello and let you know what’s new with Protocast
1219,8,47,  We have a lot going on these days
1219,8,48,"  It’s been a very busy summer getting moved into our new 50,000 sq ft building"
1219,8,49, Feb of 2020
1219,8,50,"Permanent Mold  - When most people think of casting, they think of the sand casts used to produce intricate parts and products"
1219,8,51," While yes, sand casting is one of the most recognizable forms of casting and is widely used as a favored production method, it is not always the most efficient type of cast — especially if your priority is quick production"

1222,1,0,HOME ABOUT PENTACAST SERVICES CONTACT More SERVICES Quality die casting ​ The Die Cast process allows products to be made with a high degree of accuracy and repeatability
1222,1,1, The die casting process also produces fine details such as textured surfaces without requiring further processing
1222,1,2,"  Unlike other manufacturing processes such as extrusion, the die casting process does not limit the shape of parts"
1222,1,3,"  Die cast parts are able to withstand to a broader range of temperature, making it more ideal in harsh temperatures and working environments"
1222,1,4," ​ Since PentaCast can produce complexe parts to near net shape, there is little or no machining process required thus reducing the production time"
1222,1,5, ​ PentaCast uses both hot and cold chamber processes
1222,1,6,  The hot chamber process has a short cycle time as it does not require metal to be transported from a separate furnace
1222,1,7,  Cold Chamber Die Casting is used primarily for aluminum alloys
1222,1,8," Permanent mold - gravity die casting machines ​ The Permanent mold process produces non-ferrous high density, high strength castings with a smooth surface finish compared to sand-casting"
1222,1,9," Good part repeatability, and the rapid solidification of metal creates fine grain structure with superior metallurgical properties"
1222,1,10," ​ Tilt pouring reduces turbulence as molten metal enters the die cavity, provides shorter cycle times, and requires less metal for feeding systems"
1222,1,11, Aluminum castings produced in metal molds have a tighter dendrite structure than castings produced in other processes
1222,1,12," In addition, aluminum castings are harder and have better pressure characteristics"
1222,1,13," Value added options, such as sand cores or cast-in ferrous inserts are quite simple"
1222,1,14, Prototyping and low to high volume production processes ​ PentaCast specializes in the production of aluminum and zinc parts in prototype and low-high volume production quantities through our diverse processes
1222,1,15,  Our operations are designed to deliver individual parts and complete assemblies very quickly

1222,1,17, ​ Green Manufacturing
1222,1,18,"  According to scientists, plastics takes at least a few hundreds of years to degrade fully"
1222,1,19,"  This means that obsolete plastic products are pilled up in the landfills, polluting and causing health hazards"
1222,1,20,"  Unlike plastic, die casting parts are primarily made of recycled material"
1222,1,21,"  On average, approximately 95% of the metal is recycled from salvaged parts making it a sustainable material that can be used over and over again without degradation"

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, a company's website is akin to a virtual storefront, providing customers with crucial information about its offerings. However, with the ever-increasing amount of data on these websites, analyzing thousands of companies belonging to a particular industry can be overwhelming. This makes it challenging for customers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the industry and each individual company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text analytics is a powerful tool that can offer valuable insights into analyzing the vast amount of data on company websites. Text analytics can help in various ways, from identifying similarities between companies to detecting whether a company exists in the real world or is generated by an algorithm like Chat GPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we focus on identifying the general characteristics of company websites and comparing them across companies that produce magnets under the same NAICS code. By doing so, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the industry, its trends, and opportunities for growth."

    "### Source Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this analysis is a scraped dataset of 1,227 companies that produce magnets. Python's `BeautifulSoup` package was used to scrape the data. However, due to the large size of the raw dataset, outliers were dropped by excluding links that contained words less than the 15th percentile or more than the 85th percentile. From this filtered dataset, links for 300 sampled companies were included, resulting in a final `CORPUS` of 2,270 links for 300 companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CORPUS` data was in `csv` format and was converted to a Pandas dataframe containing four columns: `company_id`, `link_num` (the number of scraped links per company), `text` (the scraped text of each link), and `words` (the number of words per link). The `CORPUS` dataframe was ultimately indexed by `company_id`."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was able to explore the general content of company websites manufacturing magnets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of PCA, we had two main axes comprising company websites: products and website configuration. Also, the more links a website had, the more it is likely to contain website configuration related content. On the other hand, the lesser links a website had, the more likely it is likely to have product related content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of word embedding did align with PCA. The t-SNE plot clearly displays the disconnection between two topics, on the top left, there existed a cluster mostly comprised of production related words. On the bottom right, there was a cluster for website related words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, LDA captured the hidden topic of our corpus: business. It provides an extra point of view, other than the known topics, proudcts and webistes. LDA, in fact, did really capture the latent topic space that was not identified in PCA and word embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "For sentiment analysis, I initially expected trust and anticipation would be the dominant emotion, which was proved by the mean emotion of all companies. However, when I dived deep into a company level using wordcloud, the word combinations were not relevant with the emotion itself, for anger, turst, and anticiapation. Also, the word 'die' was misclassified, regardless of the context of our corpus, leading to the overall misinterpreation of sentiment within the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, this project successfully identified the two main semantic axes of company websites producing magnets through PCA and word embedding, and revealed an additional topic through LDA. However, there were limitations to this project due to the lack of direct or chronological order in company websites, making it impossible to capture the sequential order of emotion and plot, and the absence of linkage between links, making it difficult to detect connections between them. Nonetheless, this textual analysis can serve as a valuable reference for individuals seeking to gain a better understanding of companies beyond standardized data such as company reports or stock trends."
